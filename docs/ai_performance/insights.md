# Insights from Common Errors

## Potential Insights from E0774
1. **Syntax Boundary Awareness**:
   - AI needs better understanding of Rust's attribute placement rules
   - Could be improved with more precise syntax tree analysis

2. **Pattern Recognition Limits**:
   - Over-reliance on surface-level patterns without deeper syntax understanding
   - Suggests need for more contextual validation

## Potential Insights from E0499
1. **Visitor Pattern Complexity**:
   - Recursive AST traversal creates hidden borrow chains
   - Need better modeling of ownership flows in documentation
   - Current implementation doesn't clearly separate lookup/mutation phases

2. **LLM Limitations**:
   - Tendency to focus on local context over full ownership graph
   - Difficulty anticipating recursive borrow scenarios
   - Over-reliance on compiler rather than preemptive design

3. **Improvement Opportunities**:
   - Could benefit from ownership-aware code generation
   - Need better visualization of borrow chains
   - Should document expected mutation patterns
