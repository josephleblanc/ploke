Let me analyze the architecture and visibility resolution plans to give you a comprehensive review:

**Project Context (from PROPOSED_ARCH_V3.md):**
1. Ploke is a RAG system for code generation/refactoring that builds a hybrid vector-graph database of code
2. Key component is the `syn_parser` which extracts code structure into a `CodeGraph`
3. Current implementation lacks robust visibility resolution across module boundaries

**Visibility Refactor Importance:**
- Critical for accurate code suggestions since visibility rules determine what code is accessible in any given context
- Enables proper handling of Rust's module system including:
  - `pub`, `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)` etc. visibility modifiers
  - Use statement imports and re-exports
  - Crate boundary visibility rules

**Implementation Progress:**
1. **Phase 1 (Module Path Tracking) - Complete**:
   - Added `current_module_path` to `VisitorState`
   - Implemented path stack management during module visitation
   - Verified serialization works
   - Tests show it correctly tracks nested modules (e.g., `crate::outer::inner`)

2. **Phase 2 (Use Statements) - Partial**:
   - `UseStatement` struct defined but collection logic not fully implemented
   - Test cases identified but not yet written
   - Key remaining work:
     - Handling all use statement variants (simple, aliased, nested groups, globs)
     - Integration with module paths
     - Serialization testing

3. **Phase 3 (Visibility Integration) - Not Started**:
   - Requires completion of Phase 2 first
   - Will implement the resolution algorithm combining:
     - Module paths
     - Use statements 
     - Explicit visibility modifiers

**Connections to Other Components:**
1. **Database**: Visibility info will feed into query system to filter accessible items
2. **LLM Context**: Will ensure suggested code only uses visible items
3. **Refactoring**: Critical for safe automated code transformations

**Potential Weaknesses/Concerns:**
1. **Performance Impact**:
   - Module path tracking added ~15% parsing overhead (acceptable)
   - Use statement/visibility resolution may add more - needs benchmarking

2. **Edge Case Coverage**:
   - Need more test cases for complex scenarios like:
     - Re-exports (`pub use`)
     - Macro-generated items
     - `pub(in path)` visibility

3. **Incremental Adoption**:
   - Feature flags help but may complicate maintenance during transition
   - Need clear plan for when to make mandatory

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Complete Phase 2 (Use Statements):
   - Implement remaining collection logic
   - Add comprehensive tests
   - Verify serialization

2. Then we can:
   - Test current `syn_parser` behavior
   - Identify any fixes needed before Phase 3
   - Begin designing the visibility resolution algorithm

Would you like me to:
1. Propose specific test cases for use statement handling?
2. Review the current module path implementation in more detail?
3. Help design the visibility resolution algorithm?
4. Something else to move forward?
