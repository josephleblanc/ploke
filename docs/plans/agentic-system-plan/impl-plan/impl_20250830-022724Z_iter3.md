# Impl Log Iteration 3 — 2025-08-30 02:27:24Z

Plan: `docs/plans/agentic-system-plan/impl-plan/plan_20250830-022724Z.md`
Assessment: `docs/reports/json_visitor_assessment_20250830-022724Z.md`

## Changes
- Added string heuristics for date-like (ISO8601-ish) and UUID-like detection to inform type choices.
- Added “High-cardinality fields (likely identifiers)” section to steer away from enums and toward newtype/string.
- Extended type distribution output with `str(date)` and `str(uuid)` counts.

## Evidence
- Command: `cargo test -p ploke-tui test_explore_file_visit -- --nocapture`
- Result: 1 passed, 0 failed.
- Artifacts:
  - `crates/ploke-tui/data/models/all_raw_stats.txt` updated with new sections and counters.
  - `crates/ploke-tui/data/models/all_raw_stats.json` preserved with expanded type fields.

## Snapshot Observations
- This dataset did not surface date/uuid-like fields; counters remain 0 (expected for model list response).
- High-cardinality report correctly highlights identifiers and numeric-like priced fields.

## Criteria Re-score (post Iteration 3)
- Schema coverage fidelity: 9/10 (presence/null, types incl. date/uuid, arrays, keys).
- Generality across endpoints: 8/10 (no endpoint-specific hacks; configurable caps).
- Actionable enum suggestions: 8/10 (freqs, cardinality ratio; next: per-field overrides).
- Professional serialization guidance: 7/10 (numeric-like, mixed-type, date/uuid hints).
- Output clarity and usability: 8/10 (clear sections; machine JSON).
- Efficiency and scalability: 7/10 (caps; could add sampling for huge payloads).
- Testability and iteration: 8/10 (JSON artifact enables precise assertions).

## Next Ideas
- Add date/uuid examples sample capture to JSON for quick inspection.
- Parameterize root array key beyond `data` for other endpoints.
- Optional sampling knobs and max-depth to bound traversal.
