Implementation Log — Approvals Overlay (Step 1)

Scope
- Implemented Approvals overlay UI (list + details), keybindings, and integration with StateCommand approve/deny.

Files Touched
- crates/ploke-tui/src/app/view/components/approvals.rs (new): overlay state + render function
- crates/ploke-tui/src/app/view/components/mod.rs: re-export
- crates/ploke-tui/src/app/input/keymap.rs: add Action::OpenApprovals mapped to 'a'
- crates/ploke-tui/src/app/mod.rs: state field, overlay rendering, key handling (approve y/Enter, deny n/d, open-in-editor o)

Notes
- Overlay is centered and shows proposals with status and a truncated preview.
- Approve/Deny send StateCommand::{ApproveEdits,DenyEdits} for the selected request.
- Open-in-editor key 'o' uses config `ploke_editor` or env `PLOKE_EDITOR`; spawns command with the first file path.

Next
- Step 2: Proposal persistence (disk). Initial best-effort save added; full roundtrip and load to be completed.
