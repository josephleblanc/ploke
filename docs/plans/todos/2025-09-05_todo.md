  <!-- - [ ] Cache models `ModelEndpoint` for each model after user search -->
  <!--   - [ ] add `ModelCache` keyed by `model_id` -->
- [ ] Improve model selection
  - [ ] Cache OpenRouter endpoints `Endpoints` for each model after user search
    - [ ] add `EndpointsCache`, keyed by `model_id`, e.g. `moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905`
    - [ ] update model picker to use cache when searching, before querying OpenRouter
- [ ] Investigate bug in model picker UI, where selecting
`moonshotai/kimi-k2-0905` errors on response (404)
- [ ] Expand model picker window functionality
  - [ ] Add scrolling functionality to model picker window
  - [ ] Add a way to select from among the provider list in window UI
  - [ ] Descend down into the list of endpoints with `l` or `RightArrow`
  - [ ] Ascend back up to list of models with `h` or `LeftArrow`
  - [ ] Select a model with `s` from model list (implemented), and select an
  endpoint from the list of endpoints with `s`
    - [ ] Selection should leave model picker window for model selection
    - [ ] Selection should not leave model picker window for endpoint selection
      - [ ] Instead, add a new data structure `SelectedEndpoints`, map `model_id` to `Endpoint`
      - `SelectedEndpoints` will be used during request to OpenRouter using
      `CompReq` formation in `session.rs` or `llm/mod.rs`
      - [ ] Selecting an endpoint will 
        - set `use_fallback` (forgetting exact name) to false by default
        - change `active_model` to endpoint's model name
    - [ ] Add a new command to remove a model from the `SelectedEndpoint` with `r`
- [ ] Revisit `ModelRegistry`
- [ ] Add Improve feedback for tool items in the conversation
  - [ ] new trait item: summary, with short summary of tool results
  - [ ] implement for each tool in `ploke-tui/src/tools/`
    - [ ] code edit
    - [ ] get file metadata
    - [ ] request code context
  - [ ] update tool results to include both a summary and the full results
  - [ ] when tool results are received in `session.rs`, change the added tool
  message to show summary
  - [ ] Full results are sent to a new struct that wraps a map,
  `ToolResultsCache`, mapping the summary message id to their `String` of json
  output
    - [ ] also included is any metadata about the tool call (e.g. `stats` from `AssembledContext` for `request_code_context`)
    - [ ] change `context`
