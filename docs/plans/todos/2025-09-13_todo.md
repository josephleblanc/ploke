# Todo Nov 13, 2025

(Tight todo list focused on immediate work in `ploke` project-wide)

1. Implement plans to add support for remote vector embedding.
  - implement plans in `ploke-tui/docs/reports/remote_embedding_trait_system_design_report_2025-11-13.md`
    - JL (me) has added review notes, have AI check them and update plan + ask
    questions if any clarification is needed.
  - add tests for both a HF endpoint and an OpenAI endpoint in addition to unit tests

2. (if \#1 is complete) Review readme with other priorities
