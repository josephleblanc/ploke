Begin working on the remote embedding processing.

See report in `remote_vector_indexing_support_report_2025-02-18.md`

- Q: Which remote services offer embeddings, and how much do they cost?

- When using a remote embedding service...
  - Q: how do they expect the chunks to be delivered?
  - Q: can you send many small chunks?
  - Q: are there typically many models available to do the embeddings?

- Design Choice: if an endpoint supports multiple vector embedding models, what would be the best way to allow the user to select one?

Should it be something like the model picker we currently have for choosing a model to chat with? Meaning, would we want to use a similarly trait-based approach to abstract which service exactly is used, and how much work would that be? Implementing the more generic trait-based backend was quite a bit of work, but could provide a good blueprint for how to apply this same process here.

- Q: Should there be a unified overlay for multiple config files, and how should it be organized? 

For example, should there be a good way to separate the different kinds of configs that the user might want to select, but we might want to have headings or tabs or something to allow the user to select things for, e.g. "embedding settings", "model settings" (temp, top_p, etc), or "UI settings".

Likely different tabs for settings to support:

- embeddings
- model
- UI (should it be keybinds also?)

Q: What would be the best way to handle settings like this in ratatui?

The goal is to have a tab-style of different selectable items. So we would make an overlay which would go over the TUI, which would probably be a ratatui box, and then have different menu items across the top. The user should be able to use directional arrows to select a tab or to select a menu item. When moving down through each of the selectable config settings, I would want to have:

1. A title of the config that would be adjusted
2. A field that would be like a typical form - e.g. a dropdown/fill in/selectable that would be chosen by the user.
  - when moving down to a new thing to be selected, the row that is selected should change its background color
3. When leaving the settings window a window should pop up to confirm the user's choices.

Q: Should there be both a text file and an overlay picker that will allow the user set the items in addition to the overlay?

Yes, and in fact we probably want to just go with a text-based way to make the selections first. Probably a toml would be a good way to handle this stuff, with some kind of default settings already made, and we should include a default file that has most of the selectable items commented out.
