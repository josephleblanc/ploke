  - [ ] add a way to resolve the target directory.
    - [x] implement `resolve_target_dir` in `parser.rs`
    - [x] add docs + unit tests for `resolve_target_dir` in `parser.rs`
  - [ ] Add UI support to process user input following `/index start` into a
  form that can be accepted by `StatusCommand::IndexWorkspace`
  - [ ] Add error messages instead of panic! for graceful failures


- [ ] Add support for other models that can be used as the LLM endpoint
  - more steps here

- [ ] Get longer LLM responses to show up correctly in the terminal UI instead
of being invisible when they are longer than the terminal chat window.

## ploke workspace

- [ ] Improve the README, tet it to a point where I can start sharing the
project publicly and provide users with a good first impression, easy to use
quickstart and demo, and a clear path to contribution or submitting issues.
