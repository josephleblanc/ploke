# ADR-016: Create a Survey Mode for the UI

## Status
PROPOSED 2025-06-09

## Context
The usual work flow for developers involves prompting an LLM to make some change to their code base. However, it may be possible to provide LLM-driven suggestions asynchronously. This could offer a new way to suggest natural next features for the user, or possibly alternative ideas that they might not have thought of themselves. This could be based on user prompt (a 'suggest' command), and would need careful handling of context window, but could use pre-scripted datalog queries to survey the code base.
