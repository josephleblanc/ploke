# Exposed Usage

This document tracks every location in our code that relies on escape hatches and why.

The stated goal of our program is to strive towards the "program as proof" concept of correctness articulated by the Curry-Howard correspondence. However, as we are a rapidly growing project we may not have the time to design or refactor all aspects of our code base with as much validity as desired. Therefore we will use some "escape hatches" as necessary to enable ergonomic functionality, only on low-level functionality wherever possible. We will document all such occurrences for review and future refactoring.
