## Operating Rule

Work must be coverage-matrix driven, not attention driven. The active bucket is only the next bounded slice, not the whole goal. Once a bucket meets its "done for now" threshold, switch to the next uncovered bucket unless there is a correctness failure or broken downstream contract.

Before starting a new call-graph slice, check this document and state:

```text
Current bucket:
Exit criteria:
Status:
Next bucket:
Reason to stay in current bucket:
```

If the reason to stay is only "there is another nice improvement nearby", write it in the parking lot and switch buckets.

## Switch Criteria

A supported bucket is done for now when it has:

- one real-corpus positive proof when a real target case exists;
- one DB assertion over the persisted call graph;
- one RAG propagation assertion if the data is exposed through RAG;
- one TUI/tool assertion if the data is exposed through a tool;
- one consolidated doc note for the chunk.

An unsupported bucket is done for now when it has:

- one real-corpus or fixture-backed source oracle;
- a fail-closed assertion that no traversal edge is invented;
- a visible blocker/frontier/proof row when the model stores one;
- a short reason in the matrix explaining what implementation capability is missing.

No bucket should receive more than four consecutive commits without re-checking this matrix and either switching buckets or recording a concrete reason to stay.

## Current Bucket

Current bucket: regular free-function multi-hop traversal.

Exit criteria:

- Identify a real axum chain shaped like `free_fn_a -> free_fn_b -> free_fn_c`, or record that axum lacks a suitable current-fixture chain and select another real GitHub fixture from `docs/testing/BACKUP_DB_FIXTURES.md`.
- Add a DB path assertion proving `call_paths_between(..., max_depth: 2)` preserves both ordered edges.
- If exposed downstream, add RAG and TUI/tool assertions that the same path is visible through existing exact call-path or summary surfaces.
- Record the source oracle and verification in one consolidated doc update.

Reason to switch here now: method/trait-method multi-hop has enough current proof for this stage, while regular free-function multi-hop is not yet proven by a real-corpus multi-hop test.

## Coverage Matrix

| Bucket | Current status | DB proof | RAG proof | TUI/tool proof | Real-corpus target | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Method / trait-method multi-hop | Met for now | `RequestExt::extract -> extract_with_state -> FromRequest::from_request` two-hop paths and summaries | Exact call paths, expansion, impact, reach | `code_item_lookup` two-hop payload and UI counts | axum | Do not deepen by default; switch buckets unless a regression appears. |
| Regular free-function one-hop | Covered | `parse_attrs`, `run_ui_tests`, and related target fanout assertions | Exact call-context tests for current real-corpus function callers | `code_item_lookup` function caller regressions | axum | Use as source pool for finding a free-function multi-hop chain. |
| Regular free-function multi-hop | Gap | Not yet proven as a real-corpus two-hop path | Not yet proven | Not yet proven | TBD | Current bucket. Find source oracle and prove ordered two-edge traversal. |
| Inherent method one-hop | Covered/partial | Examples include `Json::from_bytes` and related method/associated-function rows | Exact call-context propagation exists | Exact lookup regressions exist | axum | Revisit only after broader buckets have at least one proof. |
| Associated-function path calls | Covered/partial | `Self::from_bytes`, `E::from_request`, `MethodRouter::new` style rows | Impact/reach summaries carry relation/kind | Tool payloads carry relation/kind and callsite buckets | axum | Later: separate associated-function multi-hop bucket if needed. |
| Constructors | Covered one-hop | Tuple struct / enum variant constructor rows are asserted in real-corpus matrix | Some exact context propagation exists | Tool regressions include variant/constructor rows | axum | Later: multi-hop constructor path only if a real usage question requires it. |
| External dependency frontier | Covered as frontier | External rows are exposed but not traversed | Reach summaries expose external frontier calls | Tool summaries count/display frontier rows | axum | Keep fail-closed; do not convert to traversal without external-summary semantics. |
| Unsupported receiver shapes | Covered as blockers/frontier, not traversal | Targetless/unsupported rows for field receivers, await receivers, local receiver gaps | RAG preserves blocker/frontier rows | Tool tests surface unsupported rows/counts | axum | Future implementation bucket after binding/type tracking plan. |
| Dynamic callable values | Partial/fail-closed | Fixture and real-corpus targetless rows exist; no general traversal | RAG preserves dynamic callable blockers where projected | Tool targetless matrix covers current rows | axum plus local fixture | Needs binding tracking and callable-value model before traversal. |
| Closures / nested body ownership | Partial/gap documented | Some nested rows intentionally absent to avoid flattening outer owners | RAG follows current DB surface | Tool coverage follows current DB surface | axum `parse_attrs` closure-body rows | Future bucket: closure/async body ownership before multi-hop closure traversal. |
| Import / re-export / glob completeness | Partial | Explicit and some imported path calls work; broader re-export/glob gaps remain | Downstream only sees DB-resolved subset | Tool coverage follows current DB-resolved subset | axum | Later resolver bucket; keep strict source oracles for missing fanout. |
| DB usage summaries | Strong current surface | `call_impact_for_target`, `call_reach_for_owner`, paths, source files/modules, buckets, boundary/frontier rows | N/A | N/A | axum | Add fields only when they answer a matrix question, not opportunistically. |
| RAG usage summaries | Strong current surface | N/A | Exact call paths, impact, reach, source metadata | N/A | axum | Add only when DB bucket already has proof. |
| TUI/tool usage summaries | Strong current surface | N/A | N/A | `code_item_lookup`, `code_item_edges`, and exact call-path tool coverage | axum | Keep tool changes thin; do not invent semantics outside RAG/DB. |

## Parking Lot

- Add a real-corpus regular free-function two-hop proof.
- Decide whether associated-function multi-hop needs a distinct proof row or can stay covered by the method/trait-method chain for now.
- Add binding tracking plan that ties syntax body ownership, local bindings, and type graph edges before attempting receiver/dynamic traversal.
- Split future resolver work by capability: local binding, field receiver, closure body owner, import/re-export/glob, trait dispatch.
- Consider adding a small status table to `README.md` only after this matrix has stabilized.

## Workflow Checks

Before implementation:

- Pick one matrix row as the bucket.
- State its exit criteria.
- Confirm whether DB-only proof is enough or whether RAG/TUI exposure is part of the row.

During implementation:

- Batch related assertions in table-driven tests where practical.
- Avoid adding parser breadth without a matching DB/RAG/tool proof or an explicit unsupported-row assertion.
- Commit at logical boundaries.

After implementation:

- Mark the bucket status in this document or in the coverage inventory.
- Move to the next uncovered bucket unless the current bucket still fails its stated exit criteria.
