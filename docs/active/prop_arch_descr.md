Pipeline Stages as Crates: The architecture explicitly defines separate crates
   for each stage of the ingest pipeline. This is a crucial design decision that 
   implicitly promotes concurrency safety by creating boundaries and reducing    
   shared mutable state. Each crate can manage its own internal state.

Inter-crate: The crate structure is the biggest strength here.  Well-defined  
   interfaces between crates minimize shared mutable state.  Each crate can      
   manage its own internal concurrency without directly impacting others.        
   However, careful attention must be paid to data passed between crates to      
   ensure it's either immutable or properly synchronized. 

CozoDB as a Centralized Store: CozoDB is presented as a central, persistent   
   store. This implies that concurrency control will largely be handled by CozoDB
   itself (transactions, locking, etc.). The crates interacting with CozoDB will 
   need to be mindful of its concurrency model, but the core concurrency 

Asynchronous Streams (Mentioned in Miscellaneous): The mention of asynchronous
   streams suggests a reactive approach to handling IDE events, which can improve
   responsiveness and concurrency.

LLM Integration: The LLM integration is a potential source of complexity and  
   technical debt.  LLMs can be slow and unreliable, and integrating them into a 
   real-time system requires careful consideration.

Model Provenance Verification: The XChaCha20-Poly1305 signatures are a good   
   idea, but add complexity to model management.

Mocking CozoDB and LLM:  Using mock implementations of CozoDB and the LLM     
   backend can reduce complexity and accelerate the MVP, but it's important to   
   ensure that the mock implementations accurately reflect the behavior of the   
   real systems.
