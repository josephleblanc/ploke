# AI Workflow Design Document Checklist

## AI Workflow Instructions
<!-- Process these tasks in sequence. Keep human in loop. Never mark complete without explicit confirmation. -->

- [ ] Outline decision tracking methodology
- [ ] Create ADR (Architecture Decision Record) template
- [ ] Define version control strategy for design docs
- [x] AI/Human Interface Patterns
  - [x] Develop feedback loop protocol
  - [x] Define explainability requirements
  - [x] Create cognitive load management plan
- [x] Document Index Infrastructure
  - [x] Create AI-assisted workflow taxonomy
  - [x] Define cross-document linking standards
  - [ ] Establish automated index generation

### Phase 2: Core Content Development
