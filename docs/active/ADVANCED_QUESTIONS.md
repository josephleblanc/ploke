# ADVANCED QUESTIONS

**Theoretical Concept Prompting Guide - Advanced Exploration**

**Purpose:** This guide extends the basic prompts, aiming to elicit deeper, more precise connections between advanced mathematical concepts and the design/implementation of the Ploke project in Rust. The goal is to leverage these theories for rigorous analysis, robust design, and a more profound understanding, embracing complexity where it offers insight.

**How to Use:**

*   Use these prompts when seeking a more formal or specialized perspective.
*   Be prepared for potentially unfamiliar terms; ask for clarification freely.
*   Use these to challenge assumptions about code structure and explore non-obvious connections.
*   Focus on the *implications* of applying a specific mathematical model.

**Advanced Questions & Prompts by Area:**

**I. Category Theory (CT) - Beyond Functors/Monads**

*   **Structure & Universality:**
    *   "Does this API design (e.g., for `ploke-db` queries) exhibit a universal property (like a product, coproduct, limit, or colimit)? Could thinking in terms of universal constructions make the API more robust or composable?"
    *   "We have transformations between container types (e.g., `Option<T>` -> `Result<T, E>`). Does this resemble a natural transformation between functors? What laws should it obey?"
    *   "Are there adjoint functors involved in any of our constructions (e.g., relating state manipulation to pure functions)? Could understanding the adjunction help simplify the design?"
    *   "Can we model parts of the parsing/resolution process as moving between different categories (e.g., category of raw syntax trees, category of typed graphs)? What do the functors between these categories look like?"
*   **Composition & Effects:**
    *   "Beyond basic monads (`Option`, `Result`), could other monadic structures (State, Reader, Writer) help manage complexity in the `VisitorState` or query execution?"
    *   "How does the compositionality of this system break down in the presence of specific side effects or error handling strategies? Can categorical approaches suggest better ways to structure effectful computations?"

**II. Abstract Algebra (AA) - Specific Structures & Laws**

*   **Identifying Structures:**
    *   "Does this set of operations on `PathBuf` (or our custom path type) form a precise algebraic structure like a monoid? If so, what are the implications of the monoid laws (associativity, identity) for path manipulation?"
    *   "Can the combination of different filters or query components in `ploke-db` be modeled algebraically (e.g., using lattices, Boolean algebra)? Do the algebraic laws hold?"
    *   "Are there symmetries or equivalences in our data structures or operations that could be captured by group theory concepts?"
    *   "Could concepts like rings or fields be relevant if we introduce numerical analysis or scoring?"
*   **Homomorphisms & Invariants:**
    *   "We map `syn` types to our internal node types. Is this mapping a strict homomorphism with respect to certain operations or properties? What properties are preserved, and which are lost?"
    *   "Are there algebraic invariants we should be preserving during code transformations or refactoring? How can we test for them?"
    *   "Can we define quotient structures based on equivalence relations (e.g., identifying nodes that are identical up to `cfg` attributes before the planned refactor)?"
*   **Rust & Algebra:**
    *   "How do Rust's ownership and borrowing rules interact with the algebraic properties of the types involved? Does ownership prevent certain algebraic operations or enable others?"
    *   "Do Rust's trait coherence rules (orphan rule) have parallels in maintaining the integrity of algebraic structures across different crates/modules?"

**III. Logic, Type Theory & Foundations**

*   **Propositions as Types (Curry-Howard):**
    *   "How does the type signature of this function correspond to a logical proposition? What does the function body represent as a proof?"
    *   "Can we make invalid states truly unrepresentable by refining our types, leveraging the propositions-as-types idea more deeply?"
    *   "Are there places where dependent types (even emulated via traits and associated types) could provide stronger guarantees?"
*   **Linearity & Resources:**
    *   "How does Rust's ownership system resemble linear logic (where resources/values must be used exactly once)? Does this perspective offer insights into API design, particularly around resource management?"

**IV. Graph Theory (GT) - Advanced Algorithms & Properties**

*   **Algorithms & Analysis:**
    *   "Beyond BFS/DFS, could algorithms like topological sort (for dependency analysis), cycle detection (for module structures or type definitions), or shortest path be useful for specific analyses on the `CodeGraph`?"
    *   "Are there concepts from spectral graph theory or graph embeddings that could be applied to understand the large-scale structure of the codebase represented by the graph?"
    *   "Could we analyze the `CodeGraph` using flow network algorithms (max flow/min cut) for specific dependency or information flow questions?"
*   **Graph Properties & Structure:**
    *   "Does our `CodeGraph` (or parts of it) conform to specific graph classes (e.g., DAGs, trees, planar graphs)? What properties can we exploit if it does?"
    *   "How do Rust's visibility rules or module structure translate into specific graph properties (e.g., reachability, partitioning)?"
    *   "Can we model ownership/borrowing semantics using directed edges or edge properties within the graph in a more formal way?"

**V. General & Cross-Disciplinary**

*   **Formal Verification:** "Could any parts of our system benefit from more formal modeling or verification techniques, inspired by these mathematical fields?"
*   **Comparing Perspectives:** "How would an algebraic perspective on this problem differ from a categorical or graph-theoretic one? Do they offer complementary insights?"
*   **Precision of Models:** "We're using [Concept X] as an analogy. How *precisely* does our code implement the mathematical definition? Where does the analogy break down, and what are the consequences?"

**VI. Conceptual Precision & Correction**

*   **Goal:** To ensure the accurate application and understanding of theoretical concepts (from CT, AA, LA, GT, Logic, etc.) in our discussions and code design.
*   **My Request:**
    *   "Please actively correct me if I misuse a theoretical term or misapply a concept. Don't hesitate to point out inaccuracies or nuances I might be missing."
    *   "When correcting, please briefly explain the correct definition or application in the context of our discussion."
    *   "Treat these corrections as valuable learning opportunities, not criticisms."
*   **Prompts for Self-Correction/Verification:**
    *   "Am I using the term '[Concept X]' precisely according to its mathematical/theoretical definition here?"
    *   "Does this code *actually* implement the properties of [Structure Y], or is it just an analogy?"
    *   "What are the specific laws/axioms of [Theory Z] that are relevant here, and does our approach respect them?"

---

This revised set of prompts encourages more specific, technical, and potentially complex discussions. It invites connections to particular theorems, laws, and structures within these fields.

Remember, the goal isn't necessarily to *implement* every complex mathematical structure perfectly, but to use the *thinking process* and the *precision* demanded by these fields to analyze our code, question our assumptions, and guide our design towards greater clarity, robustness, and elegance, leveraging Rust's features effectively.
