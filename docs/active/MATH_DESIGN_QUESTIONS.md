**DRAFT: Theoretical Concept Prompting Guide**

**Purpose:** This document provides a set of questions and prompts to encourage connecting our Rust code design and implementation in the Ploke project to relevant concepts from Category Theory, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, and Graph Theory. The goal is not necessarily to *force* these concepts onto the code, but to use them as lenses to gain deeper understanding, identify potential patterns, evaluate design choices, and inspire more robust and idiomatic solutions.

**How to Use:**

*   **Reference:** Keep this list handy during our discussions.
*   **Prompt Me:** Ask these questions directly when discussing code structure, function design, data types, APIs, or potential refactors.
*   **Personal Checklist:** Use it as a mental checklist when reviewing code or considering designs: "Have I thought about this from an algebraic/categorical/graph perspective?"
*   **Invite Exploration:** Frame questions openly, e.g., "Could [Concept X] offer any insights here?"

**Questions & Prompts by Area:**

**I. Category Theory (CT) - Focus on Composition, Structure, Mappings, Interfaces**

*   **Functions & Transformations:**
    *   "How does this function transform the *structure* of its input (e.g., `Option`, `Result`, `Vec`, `Iterator`)? Does it preserve key properties? (Homomorphism)"
    *   "Could we view this data transformation pipeline through the lens of function composition? Are there ways CT concepts could simplify or clarify it?"
    *   "This function maps type `A` to type `B`. Does this mapping resemble a standard pattern in CT (like a functor or monad), especially if `A` or `B` are containers/contexts like `Option` or `Result`?"
    *   "Are we just transforming data, or are we changing the 'context' or 'structure' around the data? How does CT talk about this?"
*   **Types & Interfaces:**
    *   "If we think of our Rust types as 'objects' and functions/methods as 'morphisms' (arrows), what does that tell us about how they interact?"
    *   "We're designing an interface (e.g., a trait, the `ploke-db` API). Are there principles from CT about composition, interfaces, or universal properties that might guide us towards a more robust or reusable design?"
    *   "Does this trait represent a shared structure or capability that could be viewed categorically?"
    *   "Is there a 'duality' concept from CT that might apply to this situation (e.g., reading vs. writing, constructing vs. deconstructing)?"
*   **State & Effects:**
    *   "How does this operation compose with others, especially if it involves state changes or side effects? Can CT models (like monads) help manage this complexity?"

**II. Abstract Algebra (AA) - Focus on Structures, Operations, Properties, Sets**

*   **Data Types & Operations:**
    *   "If we consider this data type (`NodeId`, `TypeId`, `VisibilityKind`, etc.) as a set, what fundamental operations are defined on it?"
    *   "Do these operations have algebraic properties like associativity, commutativity, identity elements, or inverses? (e.g., Does combining two `Path`s have an identity? Is it associative?)"
    *   "Could this data type and its operations be modeled as a known algebraic structure (like a monoid, group, ring)? Would that reveal anything useful or suggest missing operations?"
    *   "How are different types related? Can we think of these relationships as mappings (homomorphisms, isomorphisms) between algebraic structures?"
*   **State Management:**
    *   "Can the state transitions in `VisitorState` (or similar) be modeled using algebraic operations? Is there an identity state? Can transitions be combined associatively?"
*   **Sets & Relationships:**
    *   "How can we model the relationship between `NodeId` and `TypeId` using concepts like sets, mappings, or relations from set theory/algebra?"
    *   "Are there invariants or properties related to these sets/types that algebra could help us define or enforce?"

**III. Linear Algebra (LA) - Focus on Vectors, Spaces, Transformations (Primarily for Embeddings/Numerical Data)**

*   *(Note: Less frequently applicable to general code structure, but potentially relevant for future embedding/semantic features.)*
*   **Embeddings & Similarity:**
    *   "If we represent code items (functions, structs) as embedding vectors, how can LA concepts (dot products, cosine similarity, vector spaces) help us define and compute similarity?"
    *   "Could transformations (matrix multiplication) be used to project embeddings into different spaces for specific analysis tasks?"
    *   "Does the concept of basis or dimension have any relevance to how we structure or interpret these embeddings?"

**IV. Graph Theory (GT) - Focus on Nodes, Edges, Paths, Connectivity (Highly Relevant to Ploke)**

*   **CodeGraph Structure:**
    *   "From a GT perspective, what are the fundamental node types and edge types (`RelationKind`) in our `CodeGraph`?"
    *   "What are the implications of adding/removing/changing an edge type? How does it affect connectivity, path finding, or graph properties?"
    *   "Are there specific graph structures (trees, DAGs, cycles) we expect or want to avoid in parts of the `CodeGraph`? How can we test for these?"
*   **Analysis & Queries:**
    *   "What kinds of graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS) are relevant for analyzing relationships in the `CodeGraph` (e.g., finding all items in a module, determining visibility)?"
    *   "How can GT concepts help us design efficient queries for `ploke-db`? (e.g., finding shortest paths between related items, identifying highly connected nodes)."
    *   "Are there graph metrics (like node degree, centrality) that could provide useful insights about the codebase structure?"
*   **Phases & Evolution:**
    *   "How does the graph structure evolve between Phase 2 (parsing) and Phase 3 (resolution)? Can GT help model this transformation?"

**When to Ask:**

*   When designing a new data structure or function.
*   When defining relationships between different parts of the code.
*   When designing an API or trait.
*   When refactoring existing code.
*   When trying to understand complex interactions or state changes.
*   When the current approach feels "messy" or lacks clear structure.
*   Whenever you're curious!
