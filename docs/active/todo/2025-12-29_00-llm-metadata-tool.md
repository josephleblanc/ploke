# 2025-12-29 TODO

- Add an LLM-facing metadata tool that reports focused crate name/path and whether workspace-wide graph is available.
- Include the cargo scope behavior in the metadata output (focused by default; workspace only when a package is specified).
- Keep the system prompt hint in sync with the metadata tool output.
- Consider an ephemeral TUI notification for copy actions (e.g., “message copied!” with a short timeout).
