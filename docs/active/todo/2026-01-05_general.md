## Small issues with tools

- [ ] read_file/ns_read behavior seems poor for when the line numbers are longer than the line numbers contained in the file, I think returning nothing.
  - [ ] return well-defined tool error messaging with retry hint when using invalid line numbers.
  - [ ] add tests that verify line numbers are correct.
  - [ ] add tests verifying errors are returned as expected
  - [ ] add tests for edge cases
  - [ ] evaluate difficulty of adding line number info to tool call return values for request_code_context and other tools that get info on code items from the code graph

- [ ] fix poor tool naming/description of `request_cvode_context`.
  - [ ] change description to make it clear that this should be the primary way to search for code items.

- [ ] fix poor tool usage in LLM tool-calling workflow
  - I've noticed that
