Issues with the way we are selecting which embedding model to use:

1. Setting embedding model in too many places:
  - Database.active_embedding_set (ploke/crates/ploke-db/src/database.rs)
  - EmbeddingSource (ploke-embed/src/indexer/mod.rs) via
    - EmbeddingProcessor (ploke-embed/src/indexer/mod.rs)
    - IndexerTask (ploke-embed/src/indexer/mod.rs)
    - AppState (ploke/crates/ploke-tui/src/app_state/core.rs)
  - Core issue: 
    - (fine) we have a way to mutate the Database.active_embedding_set, since
    `active_embedding_set` is a `Arc<RwLock<EmbeddingSet>>` with accessor
    methods in ploke-db.
    - (problem) we **do not** have a way to mutate `IndexerTask` within
    `AppState`, as it is held in `AppState.indexer_task`, which is
    `Arc<IndexerTask>` and is set once on app startup.
      - See `IndexerTask::index_workspace` callsite: ploke/crates/ploke-tui/src/app_state/handlers/indexing.rs
      - See initial app configuration in `try_main`:  ploke/crates/ploke-tui/src/lib.rs

Possible solutions:
  - [ ] Change `IndexerTask`, or possibly the nested `EmbeddingSource` to be
  `Arc<RwLock<EmbeddingSource>>`

Note 2025-12-16 afternoon

- ended up creating a new `EmbeddingRuntime` object that holds a reference to
the database active embedding set and the `EmbeddingProcessor` so we can change
both in one place
  - see `ploke/crates/ingest/ploke-embed/src/runtime.rs`
