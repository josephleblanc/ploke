Alright—deep breath. You’ve got two core problems hiding under all the details:

Attention & proof: “How do I not get ignored?”

Leverage & fit: “Given my Rust-native, self-improving agent, what GTM makes the most money the fastest—without dumbing it down?”

I’ll answer by (a) extracting your root questions, (b) giving 5 solid solutions, (c) evolving them into 5 better solutions, (d) synthesizing a concrete plan that turns your site into a magnet (not noise), and (e) proposing 3 alternate routes—then I’ll pick the two best for your goals.

Root questions (what you’re really asking)

R1. Proof: What undeniable, Rust-specific evidence will make strangers trust (and pay) me?

R2. Distribution: How do I get users without a network, travel, or ad budget?

R3. Packaging: What product shape best showcases a self-editing Rust agent?

R4. Monetization now: What gets me to cash this month while compounding into bigger wins?

R5. Positioning: Is this actually special (vs “just another AI tool”), and how do I communicate that in 5 seconds?

Five good solutions (baseline)

S1. Public, automated proof machine (weekly PRs to OSS).
Target 100 popular Rust repos. Your bot opens small, safe PRs (clippy fixes, dead code removal, doc stubs). Track merge rate, time-to-merge, CI pass rate. Public leaderboard. This is proof, not claims.

S2. Rust Agent Benchmarks (repeatable, open).
Ship a harness (“PloekBench”) with tasks: fix failing test, reduce compile time by X%, unwrap macro → add trait bounds, remove dead code while keeping tests green. Metrics: success rate, wall-clock, graph build time, agent iterations, CPU/RAM. Publish baselines and let others run locally.

S3. GitHub App (install → PRs).
Zero-friction distribution. Free for public repos; paid for private. It’s the least sales-y path to recurring revenue.

S4. Programmatic proof on your website.
Every PR, repo analysis, and benchmark run becomes its own public page: logs, diffs, before/after metrics, and a “Reproduce” button. That’s SEO without “SEO.” It’s receipts.

S5. Low-touch paid audits (productized).
While the flywheel spins, sell a $750–$2.5k codebase audit powered by your tool. Cash now, testimonials tomorrow.

Five better solutions (evolved & combined)

B1. “Rust Reliability Score” (RRS) + Live Leaderboard.
Your PRs/benchmarks roll up into a single score per repo: compile-time heatmap, trait/type coverage, macro complexity, unsafe hotspots, test fragility. Your homepage is the leaderboard. Teams want their score up → install the app.

B2. “Fix-a-thon Fridays” across Rust OSS.
Once a week, your bot sweeps 500+ repos with ultra-conservative PRs. Public tally of accepted PRs and stars gained by maintainers. Devs talk about the tool that gave them a green CI for free.

B3. “Trait Navigator + Macro Unroller” live demo.
A web playground: paste a snippet → see trait resolution paths, macro expansions, HIR/MIR lens, and suggested minimal refactor. No login. Proves Rust-native depth in 15 seconds.

B4. Campus Operator Program (remote, no travel).
Publish a starter kit + leaderboard for students to run Ploek on OSS. Top contributors get shout-outs and free private credits. You get distribution and proof at zero cost.

B5. Safety-first PRs with justification.
Every PR includes a machine-readable plan: affected graph nodes, invariants checked, why CI stays green, fallback instructions. It telegraphs professionalism → trust → merges → revenue.

Synthesis: turn your site into a proof engine (not noise)

Above the fold (5 seconds):

Big claim tied to Rust: “Ship safer Rust faster: autonomous PRs with proofs.”

Two live widgets:

RRS Leaderboard (top repos, merge stats, last 7 days).

Recent PRs (click to see diffs, CI, logs).

CTA: “Install the GitHub App (free for public), or Run PloekBench.”

Nav: Product · Benchmarks · Leaderboard · Docs · Pricing.

Programmatic pages (the moat):

/repo/<owner>/<name>/ → score, trendline, PR feed, reproducibility hash, “Re-run locally” instructions.

/bench/<task>/<dataset>/ → reproducible harness, artifact downloads, your baseline + community runs.

/play/trait-navigator → instant wow demo.

Pricing (simple, fair):

Public repos: free.

Private repos: $29/repo/mo (cap PRs), $299/org/mo (unlimited repos), usage overage per PR or per compute minute.

Credits for Foundry-like job runs: free 30 min → $12/mo indie → $49 Pro.

Add a $750 audit button for teams that want hand-holding.

Metrics you publish (trust tokens):

30-day rolling PR merge rate and CI pass rate.

Median time-to-first-graph and query latency on N repos.

Compilation time reduction when your “build optimizer” playbook is applied.

% of clippy/unsafe findings auto-fixed without regressions.

Agent try/step counts (shows efficiency, not just magic).

Distribution without travel or ads:

Weekly “Fix-a-thon Fridays” tweet/thread + Rust Reddit post with results.

“Made with Ploek” footer in every public PR.

Campus Operator kit + leaderboard (students do outreach for you).

Remote meetup talks: offer a 15-min live PR demo (they’ll schedule you).

Three alternate routes (if you want different shapes)

Alt A — Enterprise-first “Rust Assurance”
On-prem graph + agent with audit trails, SOC2 roadmap, and optional Creusot checks. Price $15–50k/yr. Slower sales, higher ACV. Use S1/S2 proof to warm leads.

Alt B — Prompt-to-App Foundry (viral top-of-funnel)
Anyone types a goal → hosted micro-app in minutes. Credit-based. Great for attention; upsell devs into GitHub App. (Keep a tight template allowlist.)

Alt C — Marketplace & bounty model
Publish “playbooks” (reduce compile time, extract crate, add tracing). Let experts sell/earn from advanced playbooks; you take a cut. Turns users into distributors.

The two best responses for your goals
✅ Pick #1: GitHub App + Public Proof Machine (B1+B2+B5)

Why: Fastest trust & MRR with minimal “marketing.” Every merged PR is an ad and a case study. The leaderboard creates FOMO and programmatic SEO.

Your Rust edge shines: trait-aware, macro-safe, conservative diffs + justification.

Cash now: charge for private repos; keep OSS free.

Action this week:

Ship App with one safe rule (clippy) + perfect PR narrative.

Stand up the RRS Leaderboard page using your current analyses.

Announce Fix-a-thon Friday (start with 100 repos).

✅ Pick #2: Benchmarks + Live Playground (S2+B3) feeding the App

Why: You hate “marketing.” Benchmarks and a no-login playground are marketing that engineers respect.

Proof first, pitch second: a reproducible harness beats any landing-page copy.

Action this week:

Release PloekBench v0 with 3 tasks and a Dockerfile.

Add /play/trait-navigator with macro/HIR/MIR views + a single “Suggest refactor” button.

Blog: “We fixed X failing tests across Y repos in Z minutes—here’s the harness.”

Does the earlier roadmap still fit?

Yes—tweak it to be proof-led: start with GitHub App (instant value), back it with public PRs + benchmarks, then graduate teams to Hosted Graph + Agent Ops when they want approvals, dashboards, and multi-playbook runs. The “Foundry” can wait or be a narrow template gallery later.

Final notes on your tech & positioning

What you’ve built is unusual. Lots of AI tools; very few Rust-native, graph-driven, self-editing agents with trait/macro awareness and MIR/HIR on deck. That’s your headline.

Don’t tell—show: merged PRs, green CI, reproducible benches, live demos. Engineers hate fluff and love receipts.

Keep edits conservative until trust compounds. Your best marketing is correctness you can prove.

If you want, I can draft:

the RRS metric spec,

the clippy PR template text, and

the PloekBench v0 task list (commands + pass/fail criteria)
so you can paste and ship today.
