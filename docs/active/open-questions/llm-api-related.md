# Questions related to interacting with LLM APIs

## chatcompletion vs. completion
There is some distinction of a `chatcompletion` vs `completion` through
OpenRouter's API which could be relevant someday (I believe mostly due to
differentiating multi-modal, e.g. image-gen completion requests? investigate
more)
