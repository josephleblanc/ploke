How does the LLM become a user in some circumstances?

How can the AI be used as a "user" and then perform certain actions to engage with other AI as assistants? 

Is there some way in which the ssytem/user/assistant prompt structure would be limiting for multi-agent frameworks?

Could we have the AI itself produce output that has a mirrored structure to the sypical OpenAI spec, and then instead of producing text in the "assistant" role, could it instead produce text in the "user" role? If so, would this lead to better interactions with teh otehr LLMs in the ssytem? Why or why not? To what extent is the AI attempting to recreate the foibles of a user in such circumstances, and to what extent is it able to produce good performance?
