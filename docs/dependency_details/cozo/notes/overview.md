# Comprehensive Analysis for CozoDB Schema Design

This document provides a systematic analysis of CozoDB features and how they apply to our code analysis system.

## 1. Data Types and Schema Design

### Key Insights from CozoDB Documentation:
- CozoDB supports various runtime types: `Null`, `Bool`, `Number`, `String`, `Bytes`, `Uuid`, `List`, `Vector`, `Json`, `Validity`
- Column types for stored relations include atomic types (`Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, etc.), nullable types, homogeneous lists, tuples, and vectors
- Type comparison and ordering follows specific rules (important for indexing)
- Vector types are specified with syntax like `<F32; 384>` where 384 is the dimension

### Application to Our Code:
- `NodeId` and `TypeId` (both `usize`) map to `Int` in CozoDB
- String fields like `name`, `docstring` map to `String`
- Enums like `VisibilityKind`, `TypeKind`, `RelationKind` can be stored as `String` representations
- Lists of IDs (e.g., `related_types`, `parameters`) can be stored as `[Int]`
- For embedding work, we use `<F32; N>` vector types to store embeddings

## 2. Query Language Features

### Key Insights:
- CozoScript uses Datalog-style queries with rule heads and bodies
- Inline rules use `:=` and fixed rules use `<~`
- Atoms in rule bodies can represent rule applications, stored relations, expressions, or unifications
- Aggregation operators can be applied to variables in rule heads
- Query options like `:limit`, `:sort`, `:assert` control execution and results
- Recursive queries are supported and can be used for graph traversals

### Application to Our Code:
- We use queries to traverse our code graph (e.g., find all implementations of a trait)
- Aggregations are useful for metrics (e.g., count function parameters, measure complexity)
- Rule chaining enables complex analyses (e.g., finding call hierarchies)
- Recursive queries allow us to traverse module hierarchies and dependency graphs

## 3. Stored Relations Management

### Key Insights:
- Stored relations are created with `:create <NAME> <SPEC>` or `:replace <NAME> <SPEC>`
- **Important**: `:create` fails if the relation already exists, while `:replace` overwrites it
- Columns before `=>` form keys, those after form values
- Operations include `:put`, `:rm`, `:insert`, `:update`, `:delete`
- Transactions allow for atomic operations across multiple queries
- Indices can be created for performance: `::index create r:idx {b, a}`
- Triggers can be attached to relations for automatic actions

### Application to Our Code:
- We use `:replace` instead of `:create` in test code to avoid conflicts when tests are run multiple times
- Keys are chosen for efficient lookups (e.g., `id` for unique nodes, `name` for lookups)
- Indices are created for performance, especially for relationship traversals
- System operations like `::relations` can be used to check if relations exist before operations

## 4. Vector Search Capabilities

### Key Insights:
- CozoDB supports vector embeddings and similarity search through HNSW indices
- Vector fields are defined with syntax like `<F32; 384>` where 384 is the dimension
- HNSW indices are created with `::hnsw create <REL_NAME>:<INDEX_NAME> {...}`
- Vector search uses the `~` operator: `~relation:index{bindings | parameters}`
- Parameters include `query:` (the query vector), `k:` (number of results), and `ef:` (search depth)
- The HNSW graph can be directly queried as a relation

### Application to Our Code:
- We store code embeddings in a relation with a vector field
- HNSW indices enable efficient similarity search across code snippets
- Vector search allows us to find semantically similar code
- The HNSW graph structure can be analyzed for additional insights

## 5. Best Practices and Optimizations

### Key Insights:
- Handling nulls requires careful consideration (using coalesce or explicit checks)
- Breaking queries into smaller rules often improves performance
- For recursive queries, using aggregation can prevent memory issues
- Set semantics in relations means duplicates are automatically removed
- Checking if relations exist before operations prevents errors

### Application to Our Code:
- We handle nullable fields carefully (e.g., optional return types)
- For complex traversals, we use recursive relations with proper termination conditions
- We check for relation existence before operations to ensure robustness
- We use `:replace` instead of `:create` in test code to make tests idempotent

## Example Schema for Code Embeddings

```sql
:replace code_embeddings {
    id: Int, 
    node_id: Int, 
    node_type: String, 
    embedding: <F32; 384>, 
    text_snippet: String
}

::hnsw create code_embeddings:vector {
    dim: 384,
    m: 16,
    dtype: F32,
    fields: [embedding],
    distance: Cosine,
    ef_construction: 50
}
```

## Transformation Strategy

To transform our `CodeGraph` into this CozoDB schema:

1. **Node Transformation**:
   - Iterate through each collection in `CodeGraph` (functions, defined_types, etc.)
   - For each node, insert a record in the corresponding relation
   - Store the node's ID for relationship mapping

2. **Relationship Transformation**:
   - Process the `relations` vector in `CodeGraph`
   - Insert each relation into the `relations` relation
   - Create additional specific relationship records as needed

3. **Detail Transformation**:
   - For complex nodes with nested structures (e.g., functions with parameters)
   - Extract the details into the appropriate detail relations

4. **Type System Transformation**:
   - Process the `type_graph` to populate the `types` relation
   - Create type relationships in `type_relations`

5. **Embedding Transformation**:
   - Generate embeddings for code snippets
   - Store embeddings in vector fields
   - Create HNSW indices for similarity search

This schema design provides:
- Efficient storage of our code graph structure
- Support for complex queries across the code graph
- Vector search capabilities for semantic code understanding
- Performance optimization through strategic indexing
