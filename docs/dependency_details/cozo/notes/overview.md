# Comprehensive Analysis for CozoDB Schema Design

Let's systematically analyze the CozoDB documentation and our Rust code to design an effective schema for our code analysis system.

## 1. datatypes.rst

**Key Insights:**
- CozoDB supports various runtime types: `Null`, `Bool`, `Number`, `String`, `Bytes`, `Uuid`, `List`, `Vector`, `Json`, `Validity`
- Column types for stored relations include atomic types (`Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, etc.), nullable types, homogeneous lists, tuples, and vectors
- Type comparison and ordering follows specific rules (important for indexing)

**Application to Our Code:**
- `NodeId` and `TypeId` (both `usize`) map to `Int` in CozoDB
- String fields like `name`, `docstring` map to `String`
- Enums like `VisibilityKind`, `TypeKind`, `RelationKind` can be stored as `String` representations
- Lists of IDs (e.g., `related_types`, `parameters`) can be stored as `[Int]`
- For future embedding work, we can use `<F32; N>` vector types

## 2. queries.rst

**Key Insights:**
- CozoScript uses Datalog-style queries with rule heads and bodies
- Inline rules use `:=` and fixed rules use `<~`
- Atoms in rule bodies can represent rule applications, stored relations, expressions, or unifications
- Aggregation operators can be applied to variables in rule heads
- Query options like `:limit`, `:sort`, `:assert` control execution and results

**Application to Our Code:**
- We can use queries to traverse our code graph (e.g., find all implementations of a trait)
- Aggregations will be useful for metrics (e.g., count function parameters, measure complexity)
- We can use rule chaining for complex analyses (e.g., finding call hierarchies)

## 3. stored.rst

**Key Insights:**
- Stored relations are created with `:create <NAME> <SPEC>`
- Columns before `=>` form keys, those after form values
- Operations include `:put`, `:rm`, `:insert`, `:update`, `:delete`
- Transactions allow for atomic operations across multiple queries
- Indices can be created for performance: `::index create r:idx {b, a}`
- Triggers can be attached to relations for automatic actions

**Application to Our Code:**
- We'll need to create stored relations for each major node type (functions, types, etc.)
- Keys should be carefully chosen for efficient lookups (e.g., `id` for unique nodes, `name` for lookups)
- Indices will be crucial for performance, especially for relationship traversals
- Triggers could be used to maintain consistency (e.g., when a type is deleted, remove all references)

## 4. sysops.rst

**Key Insights:**
- System operations start with `::` and must appear alone in a script
- `::relations` lists all stored relations
- `::columns <REL_NAME>` lists columns for a relation
- `::indices <REL_NAME>` lists indices
- `::describe <REL_NAME> <DESCRIPTION>` adds documentation
- `::compact` runs database compaction

**Application to Our Code:**
- We can use system ops to manage our schema (create indices, document relations)
- `::explain` will be useful for debugging complex queries
- `::compact` should be run periodically for performance

## 5. tips.rst

**Key Insights:**
- Handling nulls requires careful consideration (using coalesce or explicit checks)
- Breaking queries into smaller rules often improves performance
- For recursive queries, using aggregation can prevent memory issues
- Set semantics in relations means duplicates are automatically removed

**Application to Our Code:**
- We should handle nullable fields carefully (e.g., optional return types)
- For complex traversals (e.g., finding all dependencies), we should use recursive relations with proper termination conditions
- When analyzing large codebases, we should leverage CozoDB's efficient query execution


### 5. Vector Embeddings (for future use)

```
:create code_embeddings {
    node_id: Int =>
    embedding: <F32; 1536>,  // Assuming 1536-dimensional embeddings
    text_snippet: String
}

::hnsw create code_embeddings:vector {embedding}
```

## Transformation Strategy

To transform our `CodeGraph` into this CozoDB schema:

1. **Node Transformation**:
   - Iterate through each collection in `CodeGraph` (functions, defined_types, etc.)
   - For each node, insert a record in the corresponding relation
   - Store the node's ID for relationship mapping

2. **Relationship Transformation**:
   - Process the `relations` vector in `CodeGraph`
   - Insert each relation into the `relations` relation
   - Create additional specific relationship records as needed

3. **Detail Transformation**:
   - For complex nodes with nested structures (e.g., functions with parameters)
   - Extract the details into the appropriate detail relations

4. **Type System Transformation**:
   - Process the `type_graph` to populate the `types` relation
   - Create type relationships in `type_relations`

This schema design provides:
- Efficient storage of our code graph structure
- Support for complex queries across the code graph
- Extensibility for future features like embeddings
- Performance optimization through strategic indexing

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this schema design or the transformation strategy?
