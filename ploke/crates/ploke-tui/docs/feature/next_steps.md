# Next Steps (duplicate for cross-repo docs path)

See crates/ploke-tui/docs/feature/next_steps.md for the primary document.

High-level tracks:
- Expand curated defaults and introduce a discovered-models catalog.
- Decouple providers (transport/format) from models (capabilities) for routing/fallback.
