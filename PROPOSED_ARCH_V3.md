You're touching on an important architectural consideration. Let me help clarify the distinction between Tokio and Rayon and suggest how to structure your system.

### Understanding Tokio vs Rayon

You're right about the general use cases:

- **Tokio** is an asynchronous runtime for I/O-bound tasks. It excels at handling many concurrent operations that spend time waiting (file I/O, network requests, etc.).

- **Rayon** is designed for CPU-bound parallelism. It provides work-stealing thread pools that efficiently distribute computational work across available cores.

The conflict concerns come from their different concurrency models:
- Tokio uses async/await (non-blocking concurrency)
- Rayon uses threads (parallel execution)

### Architectural Recommendation

Here's how I'd structure the system:

1. **Create a clear boundary between I/O and computation domains**
   - I/O domain: File watching, database operations (Tokio)
   - Computation domain: Code parsing, analysis (Rayon)

2. **For your core data structures**:
   - Make them `Send + Sync` but don't tie them to either runtime
   - Use `Arc<RwLock<_>>` from `parking_lot` or standard library (not Tokio's locks)
   - Consider `dashmap` for concurrent hash maps

3. **Processing pipeline architecture**:
   ```
   File Watcher (Tokio) → Parser Coordinator → Parallel Parsing (Rayon) → Database Writer (Tokio)
   ```

4. **Channel-based communication**:
   - Use `tokio::sync::mpsc` or `crossbeam::channel` to communicate between domains
   - This allows clean separation between the async and parallel components

### Concrete Example

```rust
// Simplified architecture
async fn main() {
    // Tokio runtime for I/O operations
    let (file_tx, file_rx) = channel(100);
    
    // File watcher task (in Tokio)
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        let mut watcher = FileWatcher::new();
        while let Some(event) = watcher.next().await {
            file_tx.send(event).await.unwrap();
        }
    });
    
    // Bridge between async and parallel worlds
    let parse_pool = rayon::ThreadPoolBuilder::new()
        .num_threads(num_cpus::get())
        .build()
        .unwrap();
    
    // Process incoming file events
    while let Some(file_event) = file_rx.recv().await {
        let db = db_connection.clone();
        
        // Spawn computation work on Rayon
        parse_pool.spawn(move || {
            // Parse file using Rayon's parallelism
            let ast = parse_file_with_rayon(file_event.path);
            
            // Convert to your intermediate representation
            let ir = ast_to_intermediate(ast);
            
            // Send to database writer (back to Tokio world)
            tokio::spawn(async move {
                db.write(ir).await;
            });
        });
    }
}
```

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: Tokio for watching files and database I/O, Rayon for parallel parsing work. The key is creating clear boundaries and using channels to communicate between the different concurrency domains.

Does this approach make sense for your project structure?
