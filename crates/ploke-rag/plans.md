Review the provided files and write a new document in the `crates/ploke-rag/` directory that contains concrete plans to implement the next features in the project, given that there is a separate crate responsible for direct communication with local/remote LLMs. This crate's responsibilities are outlined in the README.md, but lacks specifics for the future plans of the crate.

This project is a high quality, production-grade interface with LLMs for code generation and refactoring specifically of Rust code, and therefore demands an extremely high level of quality to meet the demands of mission-critical Rust code. Your plans should reflect this intended usage.
