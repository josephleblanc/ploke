# 0011 â€“ Implement Display/Error for McpError to fix logging fmt errors

Decisions
- Implement fmt::Display and std::error::Error for McpError so it can be used in tracing/logging with "{}".
- Keep error messages concise and consistent; propagate sources for Io and Anyhow variants.

Changes Summary
- types.rs: Added Display and Error impls for McpError.

Next Steps
- Consider deriving thiserror::Error for McpError for less boilerplate and better source chaining.
- Add unit tests for Display formatting to ensure stable messages in logs.

Rationale
- Logging with "{}" in manager.rs requires Display; implementing it resolves the E0277 compile errors.
