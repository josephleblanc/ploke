# 0013 â€“ Crate docs and config parsing unit tests

Decisions
- Add crate-level documentation to lib.rs to clarify usage, quick start, and E2E gating.
- Introduce unit tests for config parsing: priority sorting, default values, and basic shape of default config path.

Changes Summary
- lib.rs: Added top-level //! docs; removed outdated TODOs.
- config.rs: Added tests verifying TOML parsing, sorting by priority, default handling for autostart/args/env, and default_config_path shape.

Next Steps
- Unit tests for manager behaviors (restart_on_exit flow with injected spawner/mock).
- Consider moving example clients (src/context7_client.rs, src/git_client.rs) into examples/ to avoid shipping extra binaries.
- Explore structured outputs for typed clients (beyond normalized text).

Suggested PLAN.md Edits
- None required; current work aligns with M0/M1 milestones.

Rationale
- Improves discoverability and clarity for users integrating the crate.
- Increases confidence in config semantics without requiring external tools.
