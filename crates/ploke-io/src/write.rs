/*!
Phase 5 â€” Write Path Scaffolding (internal stubs)

This module provides initial scaffolding for the future write path:
- Per-file locking
- Splice-in-memory with UTF-8 guarantees
- Atomic temp-write + fsync + rename + parent fsync
- New tracking hash computation and watcher origin propagation

Note:
- Cross-crate types (WriteSnippetData, WriteResult) are expected to live in ploke-core.
- Until then, we keep local placeholders behind the crate boundary.
