# Implementation Log 016 â€” Phase 5 Minimal Write Path (splice + atomic rename)

Date: 2025-08-19

Summary
- Implemented the first functional write path:
  - Validates absolute paths and reads UTF-8 content.
  - Verifies expected TrackingHash against actual.
  - Checks byte ranges and UTF-8 boundaries.
  - Splices in-memory, writes to a temp file, fsyncs, renames atomically, and best-effort fsyncs the parent directory.
  - Computes and returns the new TrackingHash.
- Wired via IoRequest::WriteSnippetBatch; remains an internal API pending shared types in ploke-core.

Rationale
- Delivers a safe, minimal write capability that preserves UTF-8 correctness and atomicity guarantees, unblocking end-to-end flows for future tests and integrations.

Changes Made
- src/write.rs:
  - Expanded WriteSnippetData to include id and name for ContentMismatch reporting.
  - Implemented process_one_write and write_snippets_batch with error mapping to IoError/PlokeError.
  - Updated module docs to reflect the working write path.

Tests/Verification
- Manual verification pending automated tests.
- Next PR will introduce unit tests for splice correctness, boundary checks, and hash recomputation.

Impact/Risks
- Currently no per-file locking; concurrent writes to the same path could race.
- Parent directory fsync is best-effort and may be platform-dependent.

Next Steps
- Add per-file async mutex keyed by normalized path; enforce roots/symlink policy for writes.
- Expose public API once shared types (WriteSnippetData, WriteResult) move to ploke-core.
- Implement watcher origin correlation on write completion.
