# Implementation Log 010 — Context Management and Plan Progress

Date: 2025-08-19

Summary
- Advanced the Production Plan by documenting current completion status for Phases 1–3 and clarifying next steps.
- Introduced explicit conversation context management guidance to keep our active chat under token limits while we continue implementation.

Rationale
- Our token budget is the limiting factor in the near term. By pruning non-essential files from the chat and re-adding them on demand, we can continue shipping small, focused changes without context overflows.

Changes Made
- docs/production_plan.md:
  - Added “Progress Update — 2025-08-19” section summarizing current status and next steps.
- This log:
  - Added “Conversation Context Management” with a concrete list of files that are safe to drop from the conversation now, and which ones to keep.

Tests/Verification
- No runtime code changes in this step. The repository builds and tests are unchanged.

Impact/Risks
- None to functionality. Process improvement only. We will continue to keep PRs small and scoped.

Next Steps
- Phase 4 (Watcher, feature-gated) — add scaffolding for a notify-based watcher with debouncing and a subscribe_file_events API on the handle.
- Phase 7 (Path policy hardening) — plan canonicalization against configured roots and symlink policy notes.
- Continue to update the production plan and keep a 2-log window of implementation logs.

Conversation Context Management
- Goal: keep only the files we actively edit or that are critical to understand the next change in the live chat context. Add or remove files from the chat as we go.

Safe to drop from the conversation now (but keep in the repo):
- crates/ploke-io/src/tests_skeleton.rs
- crates/ploke-io/src/scan.rs (we’ll re-add when editing or extending tests/instrumentation)
- crates/ploke-io/docs/implementation-log-008.md (will be removed from repo to maintain the 2-log window)
- Large test blocks inside crates/ploke-io/src/read.rs (we will re-add this file when we modify read helpers or tests)

Recommended to keep in the conversation for upcoming steps:
- crates/ploke-io/src/lib.rs
- crates/ploke-io/src/actor.rs
- crates/ploke-io/src/handle.rs
- crates/ploke-io/src/builder.rs
- crates/ploke-io/src/errors.rs
- crates/ploke-io/src/path_policy.rs
- crates/ploke-io/docs/production_plan.md
- crates/ploke-io/docs/implementation-log-009.md
- crates/ploke-io/docs/implementation-log-010.md (this file)

How we’ll operate to minimize context window:
- When you ask for a change touching a file that is not currently in the conversation, please “add it to the chat” before I make edits.
- I will proactively suggest which files to add/remove as we change focus (e.g., when moving from builder work to watcher scaffolding).
- We will keep only the latest two implementation logs in-repo (and in the chat), removing older ones with git rm as outlined in the Production Plan procedures.
