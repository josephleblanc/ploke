Review this `ploke-io` crate using the provided code. This is currently composed of only a monolithic file, but we will likely develop a file-watcher as we rapidly develop our RAG project as a whole. 

You can see the overall project plans in the workspace-level `README.md`, which has relatively up-to-date information on the project at a high level, but may be very slightly outdated.

3. Are most in need of refactoring.

Additionally, create a second document, `AI_NOTES.md`, that has densely
