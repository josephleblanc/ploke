Review the provided code from `crates/ingest/ploke-embed` to create a comprehensive README that can be used by callers of this crate to understand its functioning.

This project is undergoing rapid development and there may be messy or unused parts of the project as we sprint ahead, but we want to identify which areas of the project are most useful right now.

All the tests are currently passing, and show that the project is now able to create vector embeddings of all the crates within the project itself.

Pay particular attention to how the crate will be used in the other parts of our project, which you can see in the `ploke-tui/README.md` provided.

Include a mermaid diagram with a high-level overview of the processes in the crate, along with a low-level and highly detailed mermaid diagram to provide more fine-grained understanding of the dataflow in this crate.

Identify areas for future improvement or extension that could:
1. Add the most utility if extended
2. Are most in need of tests
3. Are most in need of design attention or refactoring

In addition, create a densely informative AI_NOTES.md document in the same directory that provides information for AI developers working on other parts of the project that might need to use the API of this crate while building out the project.
