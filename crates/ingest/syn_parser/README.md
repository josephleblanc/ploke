Write a README for this project in the newly created file, `crates/ingest/syn_parser/README.md`, that provides both a high-level overview of the project and identifies the various pipelines of data and activity that the program supports.

The project has been undergoing rapid development, and we need to create a central document that has all the most important information for the project in a single place. This means we want:
* both the high level overview and more concrete details in terms of the way a caller will interact with the application
* identification and description of the different unified processing pipelines in the application
* mermaid diagrams of the various identified processes to provide both a high-level understanding of the coarse-grained understanding for a view of the application as a whole, as well as more detailed diagrams that show the specifics for different pipelines in the project.
