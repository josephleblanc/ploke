# Implementation log 023 â€” Fix provider selection dispatch and remove ambiguous provider field (2025-08-21)

Summary
- Fixed compile errors after implementing provider selection and OpenRouter payload cleanup in 022.
- Corrected StateCommand field mismatch for per-model provider pinning.
- Removed an unused, type-ambiguous variable in the OpenAI-style request builder.

Changes
- app/commands/exec.rs: Switched `StateCommand::SelectModelProvider` call to use `provider_id` instead of `provider_slug` to match the StateCommand variant fields.
- llm/session.rs: Removed `let provider_field = None;` which caused E0282 due to missing type inference and was unused since we explicitly set `provider: None` in the request payload.

Why these changes
- E0559: The StateCommand variant expects `provider_id`, not `provider_slug`. Using the correct field unblocks dispatch of the selection command.
- E0282: The unused `provider_field` introduced an inference hole. Removing it preserves the intent (no provider object in payload) while fixing the compile error.

Follow-ups
- Validate at the state layer that the selected provider endpoint supports tools when `require_tool_support` is enabled, and emit a clear user-facing warning if not.
- Consider documenting whether the CLI expects a provider slug or internal provider id for `provider select`. Currently we pass the second token through as `provider_id`.

Build/test notes
- Use targeted builds to avoid workspace noise:
  - cargo build -p ploke-tui
  - cargo test -p ploke-tui
