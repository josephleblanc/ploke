Here's an example approach using a conditional pre-commit hook that respects a "work in progress" flag while enforcing final validation:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Example implementation - adapt to your needs
BREAKING_FEATURE="breaking_changes"

# Check if we're allowing WIP commits
if [ -n "$ALLOW_BREAKING_WIP" ]; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WIP commit - skipping full validation (export ALLOW_BREAKING_WIP=0 to enforce)"
    exit 0
fi

# Check if breaking changes feature is enabled in any file
if grep -qr "#\[cfg(feature = \"$BREAKING_FEATURE\")]" crates/syn_parser/src; then
    echo "üîç Validating with $BREAKING_FEATURE enabled..."
    cargo test --features "$BREAKING_FEATURE"
else
    # Normal validation
    cargo check && cargo test
fi
```

**Usage:**
- During development:  
  ```bash
  export ALLOW_BREAKING_WIP=1  # Add to shell profile for persistence
  git commit -m "WIP: Partial implementation"  # Bypasses full checks
  ```
  
- When ready to finalize:  
  ```bash
  unset ALLOW_BREAKING_WIP
  git commit -m "Finalize breaking changes"  # Enforces feature-enabled tests
  ```

This example:
1. Allows temporary bypassing of full validation using an env var
2. Automatically detects usage of the breaking changes cfg
3. Enforces full testing when the feature is present and WIP mode is off
4. Maintains normal checks when the feature isn't used

You would need to:
1. Replace `breaking_changes` with your actual feature name
2. Adjust the `grep` pattern to match your cfg syntax
3. Add any additional checks from your existing workflow

Consider combining this with your existing CI/CD guardrails from the documentation!
