Key Collaboration Principles:
  - Prioritize design integrity and test robustness over quick fixes.
  - Do NOT weaken test assertions; explain failures instead.
  - Maintain existing documented coupling unless explicitly told otherwise.
  - Work in small, incremental steps.
  - All changes must be consistent with conditional compilation flags.
