# AI Workflow Development

Let's start by defining and breaking down an AI workflow for coding:

**Definition**  
An AI coding workflow is a structured process where artificial intelligence tools (like code generators, analyzers, or co-pilot systems) are strategically integrated into different stages of software development to augment—not replace—human decision-making. It focuses on:  
1. Automating repetitive tasks  
2. Enhancing code quality  
3. Accelerating problem-solving  
4. Maintaining context across development stages

**Core Components of an AI Coding Workflow**  
1. **Project Scoping**  
   - *AI Role*: Suggest architecture patterns based on requirements  
   - Example: "Given a web app needing real-time updates, suggest backend architecture options"

2. **Code Generation**  
   - *AI Role*: Write boilerplate/stub code while preserving project-specific patterns  
   - Flow: Requirement → Pseudocode → Implementation suggestions  

3. **Context-Aware Development**  
   - *AI Role*: Maintain awareness of:  
     - Project architecture  
     - Team conventions  
     - Dependency relationships  
     - API contracts  

4. **Intelligent Code Review**  
   - *AI Tasks*:  
     - Detect antipatterns *specific to your codebase*  
     - Suggest optimizations based on actual usage patterns  
     - Flag security issues in context of your stack  

5. **Testing Automation**  
   - *AI Integration*:  
     - Generate test cases from code behavior  
     - Prioritize test scenarios based on:  
       * Code change impact analysis  
       * Historical defect patterns  

6. **Deployment & Monitoring**  
   - *AI Applications*:  
     - Predict deployment risks using:  
       - Code change history  
       - Infrastructure telemetry  
     - Auto-generate rollback plans

Create feature branches for new tasks and make use of aider’s auto-commit feature. Use git merge once the feature is tested and reviewed.

Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for continuous integration which checks builds and tests on any push to the main branch or pull request against it.
