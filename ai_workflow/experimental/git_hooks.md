# Git Hooks for AI-Assisted Development

This document outlines 10 Git hooks, ranging from beginner to advanced, designed to enhance CI/CD for projects leveraging AI code assistance. These hooks are informed by the principles outlined in `ai_workflow/design/overview.md`, `ai_workflow/design/mulling_over.md`, and `ai_workflow/design/PROPOSED_DOCS.md`, which emphasize automated verification, code quality, and security.  The goal is to create a robust guardrail system that minimizes the risk of accepting flawed AI-generated code.

**Important Note:**  These hooks are examples and may need to be adapted to your specific project and workflow.  Consider using a hook manager like [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for easier maintenance and portability.

## Beginner Hooks (Easy to Implement)

1.  **`pre-commit` - Code Formatting (Rustfmt):**

    *   **Purpose:** Ensures consistent code style.  As highlighted in `PROPOSED_DOCS.md`, consistent formatting is crucial for readability and maintainability.
    *   **Script:**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo fmt --check
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Code formatting check failed. Please run 'cargo fmt' and try again."
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Simple, effective, and prevents stylistic inconsistencies introduced by the AI.

2.  **`pre-commit` - Basic Linting (Clippy):**

    *   **Purpose:** Catches common coding errors and style violations.  `PROPOSED_DOCS.md` emphasizes adherence to Rust idioms.
    *   **Script:**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo clippy -- -D warnings
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Clippy check failed. Please fix the warnings and try again."
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Identifies potential bugs and improves code quality with minimal effort.

3.  **`pre-commit` - Run Unit Tests:**

    *   **Purpose:**  Verifies that core functionality remains intact after AI-generated changes.  `mulling_over.md` stresses the importance of regression prevention.
    *   **Script:**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo test
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Tests failed. Please fix the tests and try again."
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Provides a basic level of confidence that the AI hasn't introduced breaking changes.

## Intermediate Hooks (Requires More Configuration)

4.  **`pre-commit` - Dependency Security Audit (Cargo Deny):**

    *   **Purpose:**  Checks for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.  `mulling_over.md` highlights the need for dependency security.
    *   **Script:**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo deny check
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Cargo Deny check failed. Please address the vulnerabilities and try again."
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Protects against security risks introduced by AI-suggested crates. Requires a `Cargo.deny.toml` file (see previous response).

5.  **`pre-commit` - Documentation Check (Missing Docs):**

    *   **Purpose:** Enforces documentation for all public API items.  `PROPOSED_DOCS.md` emphasizes thorough documentation.
    *   **Script:**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo check --all-targets --deny warnings
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Documentation check failed. Please add documentation for public items."
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Ensures that AI-generated code is properly documented, improving maintainability.

6.  **`pre-push` - Code Coverage Check:**

    *   **Purpose:**  Ensures that a sufficient percentage of the codebase is covered by tests.  `mulling_over.md` suggests tracking code coverage.
    *   **Script:**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo tarpaulin --verbose --ignore-tests
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "Code coverage check failed. Please increase test coverage."
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Identifies areas of the codebase that are not adequately tested, increasing the risk of bugs. Requires installing `tarpaulin`.

## Advanced Hooks (Requires Significant Setup)

7.  **`pre-commit` - Static Analysis (RustSec):**

    *   **Purpose:**  Performs more in-depth security analysis than `cargo deny`.
    *   **Script:** (Requires RustSec installation)
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo rustsec check
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          echo "RustSec check failed. Please address the security issues."
          exit 1
        fi
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Provides a more comprehensive security assessment.

8.  **`pre-commit` - Semantic Lineage Check (Experimental):**

    *   **Purpose:**  (Advanced) Attempts to trace the origin of AI-generated code to ensure it aligns with project goals and doesn't introduce unintended side effects.  This is a research area.  Could involve analyzing commit messages and code diffs.
    *   **Script:** (Conceptual - requires custom tooling)
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        # Placeholder - requires a tool to analyze code lineage
        echo "Semantic lineage check not implemented yet."
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Addresses the challenge of understanding the impact of AI-generated code on the overall project.

9.  **`post-commit` - AI Feedback Loop (Experimental):**

    *   **Purpose:**  (Advanced)  Sends the committed code to an AI model for review and feedback.  This could involve identifying potential bugs, suggesting improvements, or flagging security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Script:** (Conceptual - requires API access to an AI model)
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        # Placeholder - requires API integration with an AI model
        echo "AI feedback loop not implemented yet."
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Creates a closed-loop system where the AI continuously learns from its mistakes and improves its code generation capabilities.

10. **`pre-push` -  Automated Documentation Update & Validation:**

    *   **Purpose:**  Automatically updates documentation based on code changes and validates that the documentation is consistent with the code.  `PROPOSED_DOCS.md` emphasizes live documentation.
    *   **Script:**
        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        cargo doc --no-deps --document-private-items
        # Add checks to validate documentation consistency (e.g., using a linter)
        echo "Documentation updated and validated."
        exit 0
        ```
    *   **Reasoning:**  Ensures that documentation remains up-to-date and accurate, improving maintainability.

These hooks, when combined, create a layered defense against potential issues introduced by AI-assisted coding.  Remember to adapt these examples to your specific needs and project context.  Regularly review and update your hooks to ensure they remain effective.
