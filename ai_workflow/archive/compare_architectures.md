[REQUEST: CONTRAST PROPOSED ARCHITECTURES] 

V1: docs/archive/PROPOSED_ARCH_V1.md
V2: PROPOSED_ARCH_V2.md

ANALYSIS: Contrast the two proposed architectures.

In your response, pay close attention to:
- Concurrency strategies employed
  - Intra-crate
  - Inter-crate
  - Which approach Used (parallel, concurrent, atomic, etc)?
- Type system
  - Is the proposed type system valid for concurrency/parallelism?
  - Are there missing key details?
  - Are there differences in the interaction with cozodb?

Provide an evaluation for:
1. Version Choice: 
  - Move forward with either V1 or V2
  - Should any sections be incorporated from abandoned version?
2. Evaluate whether the chosen version is:
  - Ready for implementation as-is
  - Ready for implementation after incorporating other version
  - Requires further analysis and design
  - Should be abandoned completely

Your response **should**:
  - Provide clear and comprehensive reasoning.
  - Identify critical flaws shared in both version
  - Indicate points you are uncertain about.

Your response **should not**:
  - Include any bias for or against the project
  - Contain any errors
  - Attempt to gloss over details you require for better judgement.

You **may** ask clarifying questions if:
  - There are critical details that prevent you from making a sound evaluation
  - You are uncertain about the request
  - The answer to your question would substantially increase your confidence in
  a critical claim.
