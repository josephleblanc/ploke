Franz does indeed decide to take a vacation. And while he's away, he comes up
with a *grand* idea. The best way to demonstrate how absolutely *misguided* all
those fools back at the office are would be to take their proposal and...
implement it. He begins to smile, imagining the look on their faces when he
shows up a few weeks later, with the document they could only *dream* of having
written.

He chuckles to himself. Yes, this was going to be *fun*.

And.. oh! A great idea came to him. What if he even started with the horrible
proposal they began with, and restructured it piece... by... piece... The more
he thinks about it, the more excited he gets.

"In fact", he mutters to himself, "it's not such a bad idea. I mean, I love
Rust, I just that when I see a proposal like this it makes me think of someone
using a Stradivarius to hammer nails. Yes, you *can* do it, but it is a crime
against all that is holy."

"Not to mention, it *is* true that Rust is a bit behind in the LLM scene.
Something like this could actually be good for the community if done
*properly*."

Franz shoots an e-mail off to work, letting them know he's taking a few weeks off. He's such a senior employee with such a large stake in the company that he gets to do pretty much whatever he wants.

Then, he downloads the git files for the *inane* Bartleby's project and starts pulling it apart, one section at a time... As he does, he takes detailed notes on his changes in [FRANZ_THE_RUSTACEAN.md] and updates the [PROPOSED_FILE_ARCH1.md].

Time passes. Franz eats, sleeps, and *works*.

Ten days later he returns to work with a smug grin on his face. He's done it. The bastard has really done it.

He calls a big meeting and makes a presentation, enjoying the delicious look of
bewilderment on Bartleby's face as the idiot realizes what's happening. Franz
glories in the adulation of the crowd as he finishes a riveting presentation of
his architecture to the highly technical audience, and even his boss can read
the room and recongize Franz's genius shining through yet again.

As Franz walks out of the building, smirking to himself at his own shining intellect, he crosses the street, and is immediately hit by a bus.

...

Later, after the funeral, after his will is read, his assets are sold off in an estate sale, and everyone has forgotten about the grand idea in the face of Franz's untimely death. Everyone, that is, except Bartleby.

Bartleby bought Franz's hard drive at the estate sale, and hopes to find something of the project Franz was working on. To his astonishment, the hard drive, of course in perfect condition since it was only recently used, contains the full details of the ten days of work Franz put in to transform Bartleby's original work into a fully coherent, consistent project that achieved everything Bartleby had originally hoped.

Eyes riveted on his screen, Bartleby begins to read...
