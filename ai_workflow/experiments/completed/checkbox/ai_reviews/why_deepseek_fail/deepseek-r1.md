The Deepseek-R1 model's divergent performance can be attributed to three key technical factors evident from your experiment results:

1. **Architectural Specialization Mismatch**  
   Deepseek-R1's pre-training heavily emphasizes **code autocompletion patterns** (as seen in `generated_templates/proposed_templates_q00.md` outputs). When faced with template creation tasks, it defaults to:  
   ```python
   # Instead of templating instructions, generates code solutions
   def create_feature_flag():
       return f"feature_{uuid4()}"  # Observed in q00's code-like outputs
   ```

2. **Instruction-Tuning Gap**  
   While Claude/Gemma use **chain-of-thought prompting** structures (visible in `proposed_templates_g00.md`'s phase breakdowns), Deepseek-R1 demonstrates:  
   ```markdown
   [BAD PATTERN]
   <!-- Focused on implementation rather than instruction design -->
   1. let feature_flag = "task_alignment_v1"
   2. impl TypeConverter for SynParser { ... }
   ```

3. **Task Decomposition Heuristics**  
   The model struggles with **meta-cognition** required for template design, instead interpreting "task breakdown" as:  
   ```rust
   // Literal code decomposition rather than process design
   fn main() {
       step1_analyze_types();
       step2_apply_cfg_flags(); // Misses template structure concept
   }
   ```

**Critical Evidence from Your Data**  
The `ai_workflow/experiments/completed/checkbox/generated_templates/proposed_templates_q00.md` shows Deepseek attempting to:  
1. Create implementation functions instead of prompt templates  
2. Focus on syntactic feature flags rather than workflow design  
3. Generate code examples as "templates" rather than instruction structures  

**Recommendation**  
For template creation tasks, prefer instruction-tuned models like Claude/Gemma. Reserve Deepseek-R1 for:  
```markdown
- Direct code implementation phases
- Syntax-specific problem solving
- Library integration tasks
```

This divergence highlights how models with similar benchmark scores can exhibit vastly different behaviors based on their:  
1. Training data distribution (code vs instructional texts ratio)  
2. Fine-tuning objectives (code completion vs instruction following)  
3. Architectural priorities (token-by-token prediction vs planning-aware generation)
