You're right to focus on revising the prompt. Given Deepseek-R1's tendency to generate code directly, we need to steer it *away* from that and towards a more abstract, textual response. Here's a revised `template_generation_prompt.md`, with explanations of the changes:

```markdown
I would like you to create templates that can be used to prompt an LLM to break down a requested task into a set of subtasks that can be tracked as they are completed, and possibly includes using a cfg flag while making the changes. The use of the cfg flag would only be for changes that would cause the code base to break. For example, a refactor of the `syn_parser` crate to use   

**Important: Your response should be entirely in text format. Do *not* include any code snippets or executable code. Focus on creating a structured *textual* template.**

**In your response:**  
- Use a different feature name for the cfg to reflect set of tasks the LLM is working on.  
- Propose templates the user can reference when requesting that the LLM perform a task that may or may not require using a cfg flag (as described in musings.md).  
  - Create three example templates that can be used to generate the list of trackable subtasks for a given user request.  
  - Include a short description of the reasoning for your choices in formatting the example templates.  

**Specifically, I want you to provide templates that look like outlines or checklists, *not* code.**  Think of them as blueprints for a task list, not actual code to be executed.

Proposed Example Templates **should**:  
  - be generic: applicable to any given request  
  - vary in complexity  
  - use different formatting (e.g., numbered lists, bullet points, tables)  

Your response **should**  
- Explicitly note parts of your response you are uncertain of.  

**Example user requests**  
*   **Type Alignment:** Change the types used within `syn_parser` to align with the CozoDB schema (e.g., using `Bytes` for content hashes, appropriate numeric types for embeddings).  
*   **Send + Sync:** Ensure all publicly exposed types are `Send + Sync`. This is a good practice regardless and will prepare the codebase for future concurrency improvements.  
*   **Remove `CodeGraph` (or significantly reduce its scope):** You're right to question the value of the `CodeGraph` as an intermediary. It adds complexity without necessarily providing significant benefits. We can likely stream data directly from the `syn` AST to CozoDB.  

You are encouraged to ask clarifying questions **if you believe the answer will significantly improve** your proposed example templates.  
```

**Key Changes and Reasoning:**

*   **Explicit Negative Constraint:**  The most important addition is the bolded statement: "**Important: Your response should be entirely in text format. Do *not* include any code snippets or executable code. Focus on creating a structured *textual* template.**" This directly addresses Deepseek-R1's tendency to generate code.
*   **Reinforced "Blueprint" Analogy:**  I added: "**Specifically, I want you to provide templates that look like outlines or checklists, *not* code.** Think of them as blueprints for a task list, not actual code to be executed." This reinforces the desired output format.
*   **Emphasis on Textual Structure:**  I re-emphasized the need for structured *textual* templates throughout the prompt.
*   **Removed Ambiguity:** I tried to remove any phrasing that could be interpreted as a request for code generation.

**Why these changes might work:**

Deepseek-R1 seems to respond well to clear, direct instructions. By explicitly forbidding code and emphasizing the desired textual format, we're attempting to override its default behavior and guide it towards the intended output.  The analogy to blueprints is intended to further clarify the desired outcome.



It's still possible that Deepseek-R1 will require further prompting or fine-tuning to achieve the desired results, but this revised prompt should significantly increase the chances of success.  We might also need to experiment with different phrasing and examples to find the optimal approach.
