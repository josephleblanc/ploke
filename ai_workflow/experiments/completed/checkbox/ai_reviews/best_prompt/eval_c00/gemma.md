Okay, I've reviewed the `experiment_description.md` and the outputs from `g00_1/`, `g00_2/`, and `g00_3/`.  Based on my analysis, **Template 3 (the "Detailed Narrative with Dependencies" template) was the most effective** at generating a useful and well-structured task list. Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Granularity and Detail:** Template 3 consistently produced subtasks that were more granular and specific than the other templates. This is crucial for a complex feature, as it breaks down the work into manageable chunks.  The other templates sometimes generated tasks that were still too high-level.
*   **Dependencies:** The explicit request for dependencies in Template 3 resulted in the LLM identifying the order in which tasks *should* be completed. This is incredibly valuable for project planning and execution.  The other templates lacked this crucial element.
*   **Rationale:**  The inclusion of a "Rationale" section forced the LLM to explain *why* each task was necessary. This provides context and helps ensure that the tasks are aligned with the overall goal.  It also makes it easier to evaluate the LLM's reasoning and identify potential issues.
*   **Commit Message Generation:** The request for a commit message alongside each task is a nice touch, as it encourages the LLM to think about the practical implications of each step.
*   **Overall Structure:** The numbered list format, combined with the detailed information for each subtask, created a clear and organized plan that is easy to follow.

**Comparing to the other templates:**

*   **Template 1 (Simple Checklist):**  This template was too basic. The resulting task lists were often too high-level and lacked sufficient detail.
*   **Template 2 (Table Format):** While the table format was organized, the lack of a specific request for dependencies meant that the LLM didn't prioritize task order. The rationale section was helpful, but not as impactful as the dependency information.

**Evidence from the generated outputs:**

Looking at the responses in `g00_1/`, `g00_2/`, and `g00_3/`, the responses generated using Template 3 consistently provided more actionable and well-reasoned subtasks. For example, in `g00_3/full_task/01_deep_r1_plan.md`, the subtasks are clearly defined, have estimated effort, identify breaking changes, and specify dependencies. This level of detail is not present in the outputs from the other templates.



In conclusion, while all three templates produced *some* useful output, Template 3 was the most effective at generating a comprehensive and actionable task list for a complex feature implementation. It's the template I would recommend using going forward.
