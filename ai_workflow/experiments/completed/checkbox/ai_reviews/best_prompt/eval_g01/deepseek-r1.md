Based on the experiment results and analysis of the generated outputs, **Template 3: Detailed Narrative with Dependencies** from the `generated_templates/proposed_templates_g00.md` file appears most effective for your use case. Here's the analysis:

**Key Strengths of Template 3:**
1️⃣ **Explicit Dependency Tracking** - The requirement to list dependencies creates better awareness of implementation order  
2️⃣ **Comprehensive Risk Assessment** - Mandatory breaking change analysis with feature flag suggestions helps mitigate risks  
3️⃣ **Contextual Reasoning** - Forces the LLM to explain *why* each subtask is necessary  
4️⃣ **Progress Tracking** - Clear structure supports checkbox-based tracking  

**Evidence from Results:**  
The `g01_3/full_task/01_gemma_plan.md` output shows particularly strong results with:
- Clear sequencing (Subtask 6 → Subtask 7 dependencies for CodeGraph removal)
- Practical cfg flag use (`feature_ai_task_1` with clear justification)
- Balanced technical depth vs readability
- Explicit handling of test updates (Subtask 5) and serialization changes

**Comparison with Other Templates:**  
1. **Template 1 (Simple Checklist):** While good for simple tasks, the `only_subtask_1` results show it can miss critical dependencies between type changes and serialization  
2. **Template 2 (Table Format):** The `g01_2` Deepseek output demonstrates tables can become unwieldy for complex tasks with multiple interrelationships  

**Recommendation:**  
Adopt Template 3 for core development tasks, with Template 2 as a supplement for documentation/epic-level planning. The `g01_3/full_task/01_gemma_plan.md` response demonstrates this template's ability to handle complex refactoring scenarios while maintaining:  
- Clear implementation sequencing  
- Risk mitigation through cfg flags  
- Explicit test modernization paths  
- Compatibility with incremental development practices  

For future template improvements, consider:  
1. Adding explicit time estimation validation  
2. Including interface compatibility check items  
3. Adding cross-team coordination requirements where applicable

Okay, I need to help the user determine which generated prompt template is most    
effective for creating a checklist of subtasks for their project, specifically for 
the syn_parser refactoring. Let me start by understanding the experiment details   
and the templates provided.                                                        

First, the user conducted an experiment with three LLMs (Claude 3.7 Sonnet,        
Deepseek-R1, Gemma-3-27B) to generate templates for breaking down tasks. In Phase  
2, these templates were applied to two specific user requests. The goal is to      
evaluate which template produced the most effective subtask list.                  

Looking at the experiment_description.md, the user provided different task         
breakdowns, including "full_task" and "only_subtask_1". The generated responses are
in g01_1, g01_2, and g01_3 directories. The templates are in                       
generated_templates/proposed_templates_g00.md.                                     

The three templates are:                                                           

 1 Template 1: Simple Checklist Format - Focuses on a numbered list with effort    
   estimates, breaking change assessment, feature flags, and commit messages.      
 2 Template 2: Table Format with Rationale - Uses a structured table including     
   rationale for each subtask, effort, feature flags, and potential issues.        
 3 Template 3: Detailed Narrative with Dependencies - Provides a narrative plan    
   with subtask dependencies, effort, flags, commit messages, and rationale.       

Now, looking at the outputs for each template:                                     

 • g01_1: Used a numbered list with dependencies and explanations, produced by     
   Gemma. It's detailed but might be less structured.                              
 • g01_2: Used a table format, likely from Template 2 (Deepseek-R1). Structured,   
   includes rationale, flags, dependencies. However, the user noted that           
   Deepseek-R1 struggled with the template.                                        
 • g01_3: Used a bullet-point breakdown with detailed subtasks (Gemma's plan),     
   aligning with Template 3. Each subtask has dependencies, estimated time, cfg    
   flags, and potential issues. This seems more thorough.                          

In the full_task scenario, the _deep_r1_plan.md under g01_3 is concise but seems   
less detailed. The _gemma_plan.md is comprehensive, breaking down into 7 subtasks  
with clear dependencies and considerations for feature flags. This aligns with     
Template 3, which emphasizes detailed planning with dependencies.                  

Comparing the two main user requests: the full_task's Gemma plan effectively       
addresses type alignment, Send+Sync, and CodeGraph removal in a logical order,     
using feature flags appropriately. The only_subtask_1's Gemma plan also breaks down
type alignment into specific steps with practical considerations.                  

Templates 1 and 3 are both effective, but Template 3's detailed narrative with     
dependencies provides a clearer roadmap, especially for complex tasks. Template 2's
tabular format might be less effective for intricate tasks requiring understanding 
of task interdependencies.                                                         

Additionally, the user mentioned that Deepseek-R1 had issues generating proper     
templates, so relying on Gemma's output (Template 3) would be more reliable.       
Therefore, Template 3 (Detailed Narrative with Dependencies) from                  
g01_3/full_task/01_gemma_plan.md is likely the most effective.
