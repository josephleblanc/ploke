Okay, I've reviewed the `experiment_description.md` and have examined the outputs from `g01_1/`, `g01_2/`, and `g01_3/`. Based on that review, I believe **Template 3 (Bullet Point List with Detailed Explanation)** was the most effective at generating a useful and actionable task list. Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Detail and Clarity:** Template 3 provides the most detailed instructions to the LLM, specifically requesting a breakdown of components, descriptions, time estimations, `cfg` flag considerations, dependencies, and potential issues. This level of detail seems to elicit more thoughtful and comprehensive responses from the LLM.
*   **Cfg Flag Emphasis:** The explicit instruction to identify breaking changes and suggest `cfg` flags is crucial for a refactoring project. Template 3 consistently prompted the LLM to consider this, leading to more cautious and well-reasoned suggestions.  The other templates were less consistent in identifying when a flag was needed.
*   **Structured Output:** While the Markdown table (Template 2) *looks* organized, the responses generated using it were often less detailed and felt more like a simple listing of tasks. The bullet point format of Template 3 allowed for more nuanced explanations within each subtask.
*   **Dependency Identification:** Template 3 consistently prompted the LLM to identify dependencies between subtasks, which is essential for planning and execution.
*   **Quality of Subtasks:** Comparing the outputs, the subtasks generated using Template 3 were generally more granular, more realistic in terms of estimated time, and more insightful regarding potential challenges.  For example, the `g01_3` outputs (based on Template 3) included more specific concerns about type conversions and potential performance impacts.

**Specifically looking at the responses to the "Type Alignment" request (only_subtask_1):**

*   `g01_1` (Template 1) provides a basic list, but lacks depth in identifying potential issues and the need for `cfg` flags.
*   `g01_2` (Template 2) is more structured, but the subtasks feel somewhat superficial.
*   `g01_3` (Template 3) provides the most thorough breakdown, with clear explanations for why `cfg` flags are necessary and a good assessment of potential challenges.

**In conclusion:** While all three templates produced *some* useful output, Template 3 consistently generated the most detailed, well-reasoned, and actionable task lists, making it the most effective choice for this project. The extra verbosity in the prompt seems to guide the LLM towards a more thorough and thoughtful response.
