Here's the analysis comparing holistic vs atomic template application approaches using the experiment data:

**1. Full Task Approach (`full_task` template use):**
✅ **Pros:**
- Maintains cross-subtask dependencies (e.g., Type Alignment must precede CodeGraph removal)
- Reveals hidden integration risks early (g01_3 shows explicit Serialization → Testing dependencies)
- More natural mapping to feature flags (single `feature_ai_task_1` flag in gemma's plan)

⚠️ **Cons:**
- Can lead to overwhelming complexity (Deepseek's g01_3 plan shows 12 subtasks)
- May obscure detail on foundational tasks (TypeNode changes in g01_3/full_task are less detailed than in g01_1/only_subtask_1)

**2. Atomic Subtask Approach (`only_subtask_1` style):**
✅ **Pros:**
- Enables deep focus on specific components (g01_1 shows detailed TypeKind analysis)
- Easier incremental adoption (test type changes independently of concurrency)
- Clearer ownership boundaries (per-Subteam assignment possible)

⚠️ **Cons:**
- Risk of missing cross-cutting concerns (CodeGraph removal impacts TypeNode serialization)
- Feature flag management complexity (multiple flags across subtasks)
- Hidden dependency risks (g01_2 shows type mapping needing 4 prerequisite steps)

**Recommendation: Hybrid Approach**
1. **First Pass with Full Task Template** - Use Template 3 for initial decomposition as in `g01_3/full_task/01_gemma_plan.md`  
2. **Recursive Application to Subtasks** - Treat each major component (Type Alignment, CodeGraph removal) as sub-projects using Template 3  
3. **Maintain Integration Layer** - Keep original full_task breakdown for dependency tracking  

**Example from Experiment Data:**
The `g01_3/full_task` plan successfully demonstrates this hybrid approach by:
1. Creating high-level subtasks (1-7) for overall flow  
2. Containing nested breakdowns within subtasks:  
   ```text
   Subtask 1: Type Mapping Definition (Global)  
   ├─ Subtask 2: FunctionNode Types (Atomic)  
   └─ Subtask 3: TypeDefNode Types (Atomic)  
   ```  

**Key Factor for Choice:** The `syn_parser` refactor requires coordinated type system changes across multiple components simultaneously. The full_task template's dependency tracking (as seen in the 01_gemma_plan's Subtask 6→7 sequence) better handles these interrelated changes than atomic application.

**When to Prefer Atomic:** For isolated tasks like "Add new CLI command", or when different teams handle distinct components. The experiment's `only_subtask_1` responses suggest atomic works better for:  
- Focused technical spikes  
- Experimental features  
- Junior developer assignments

► THINKING

Okay, the user wants to consider whether using the detailed template on the full   
task versus breaking it into subtasks with separate template applications is more  
effective. Let me start by reviewing the experiment results provided.              

Looking at the experiment description, Phase 2 tested the templates on both the    
full task (which includes type alignment, Send+Sync, and removing CodeGraph) and   
the individual subtask (only type alignment). The generated plans for the full task
(g01_3) seem comprehensive, but the user is asking about the approach: whether     
handling a large task as a whole or splitting it first.                            

In the full_task responses like 01_gemma_plan.md, the approach groups all related  
subtasks under one plan, handling dependencies between major components. This could
be beneficial for seeing the big picture and ensuring all parts work together.     
However, it might be overwhelming for the LLM to handle very large tasks all at    
once, potentially missing details in specific areas.                               

On the other hand, the only_subtask_1 approach allows focusing on one specific area
(e.g., type alignment) with a more detailed breakdown. This might lead to more     
thorough subtasks for that specific component but could risk missing               
cross-component dependencies or integration points. For example, changing types    
might affect how CodeGraph removal is handled, which could be overlooked if treated
separately.                                                                        

The templates' effectiveness might vary based on task complexity. For multifaceted 
tasks where components are tightly coupled (like the full_task), the detailed      
narrative template (Template 3) helps maintain coherence. Conversely, for isolated 
tasks, individual applications might be sufficient.                                

I should consider the pros and cons of each approach. Using the template on        
full_task ensures all parts are considered together, which is crucial for          
interdependent changes. The dependency tracking in Template 3 mitigates the risk of
missing steps. However, for very large tasks, the LLM might produce a high-level   
plan that needs further breakdown. Alternatively, splitting into subtasks first    
allows depth in each area but requires careful coordination.                       

The user's project involves refactoring with multiple interdependent changes       
(types, concurrency, data flow). A hybrid approach might be best: use the detailed 
template for the full task to outline major phases, then apply it recursively to   
each major subtask for deeper granularity. This leverages Template 3's dependency  
management at both macro and micro levels, ensuring each component's details are   
covered while maintaining overall coherence.                                       

I need to present this analysis, highlighting the trade-offs and recommending a    
hybrid approach based on the project's needs and the templates' strengths. Make    
sure to reference specific examples from the experiment's generated outputs to     
support the recommendation.
