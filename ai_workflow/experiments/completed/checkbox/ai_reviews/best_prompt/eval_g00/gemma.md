You are right to call me out on my previous mistake! I apologize for referencing the `g01_x` directories when you provided `g00_x`. My analysis was based on incorrect data. Let's correct that.

I've now reviewed the `experiment_description.md` and the outputs from `g00_1/`, `g00_2/`, and `g00_3/`. Based on this review, I believe **Template 2 (Table Format with Rationale)** was the most effective in generating a useful and actionable task list. Here's a breakdown of why:

*   **Structured and Concise:** The table format forces the LLM to be concise and to explicitly address key aspects of each subtask: rationale, effort, breaking change potential, feature flag, and commit message. This structure makes the output immediately usable.
*   **Rationale Focus:** The explicit request for a "Rationale" for each subtask is crucial. It forces the LLM to explain *why* a task is necessary, which helps with understanding the overall plan and making informed decisions.
*   **Breaking Change Awareness:** Template 2 consistently prompted the LLM to consider breaking changes and suggest feature flags, leading to more cautious and well-reasoned suggestions.
*   **Effort Estimation:** The inclusion of "Effort (hours)" encourages the LLM to think realistically about the time commitment required for each task, which is valuable for project planning.

**Specifically looking at the responses to the "full_task" request:**

*   `g00_1` (Template 1) provides a basic checklist, but lacks the detailed rationale and risk assessment found in Template 2's output.
*   `g00_2` (Template 2) delivers a well-organized table with clear rationales, effort estimations, and appropriate feature flag suggestions.
*   `g00_3` (Template 3) generates a more narrative response, which is less immediately actionable as a checklist. While detailed, it requires more parsing to extract the key tasks and their associated information.

**In conclusion:** While Template 3 provides more detailed explanations, Template 2's structured table format, combined with its emphasis on rationale and risk assessment, makes it the most effective choice for generating a task list that is both informative and immediately usable for project management. The table format lends itself well to being directly translated into a checklist or task tracking system.



I sincerely apologize for the initial error. I am still under development and learning to process information accurately. I will strive to be more careful in the future.
