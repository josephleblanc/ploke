We are trying to create a template that I can use with a code assist LLM to work on my project. I've been working on an experiment to evaluate how I can best get the LLM to create a checklist of items made by breaking down a task into subtasks. Which of the generated prompts do you think was most effective in generating a set of sub-tasks the LLM can use to implement a complex feature, along with tracking (e.g. checkboxes).

I've included the `experiment_descrion.md` for context here since it has a more methodical breakdown of the way I was starting to evaluate the prompts. I've also included the files for the LLM generated responses to the claude-generated templates in g00_1/, g00_2/, and g00_3/

Which of the templates do you think was the most effective in generating a task list that would help me with my project?
