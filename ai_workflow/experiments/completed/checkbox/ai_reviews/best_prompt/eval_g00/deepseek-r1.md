Based on the experimental results and templates provided, **Template 3 from proposed_templates_g01.md** (the Detailed Narrative with Dependencies format) appears to be the most effective for generating actionable subtask lists. Here's why:

---

### **Key Strengths of This Template**
1. **Explicit Dependency Tracking**
   ```markdown
   **Dependencies:** [List of subtask IDs]
   ```
   - Forces the LLM to consider task sequencing
   - Prevents impossible/implicit ordering of work

2. **Risk Awareness**
   ```markdown
   **Potential Issues:** [List of potential issues]
   ```
   - Surfaces edge cases/risks early
   - Helps plan mitigations

3. **Implementation Guidance**
   ```markdown
   **Commit Message:** [Concise commit message]
   ```
   - Bridges planning to tangible outputs
   - Maintains context for future contributors

---

### **Example Success**
The [01_deep_r1_plan.md from c00_2](ai_workflow/experiments/completed/checkbox/data/c00_2/full_task/01_deep_r1_plan.md) shows this template in action:
- Clear type alignment priorities first
- Explicit serialization dependencies
- Pre/post feature flag testing strategy
- Schema validation criteria

---

### **Why Not Other Templates?**
1. **Simple Checklists** (Template 1):
   - Missing dependency/risk analysis
   - Often leads to unsequenced "todo soup"

2. **Tabular Format** (Template 2):
   - Too rigid for LLM output validation
   - Can produce empty/placeholder columns

---

### **Recommended Adaptation**
Add two elements from the **Phase-Driven Breakdown** template:
```markdown
**Time Estimates:** [X hours/days]
**Breakage Risk:** [Low/Medium/High]
```

This creates a hybrid approach that:
1. Forces concrete effort estimation
2. Highlights risky subtasks for prioritization
3. Maintains dependency/risk visibility

Modified template would look like:
```markdown
| Subtask ID | Description | Time Est | Risk | Dependencies | Commit Template |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ST1 | Type alignment | 4h | High | - | types: Add CozoBytes |
| ST2 | Serialization | 2h | Medium | ST1 | ser: Handle new type |
```

This blends structure with flexibility while meeting your tracking requirements.
