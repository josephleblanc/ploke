Okay, here's a structured implementation plan for the "Type Alignment" task, following your requested format.

```
# Structured Implementation Plan: Type Alignment

## Task Overview
**Objective**: Adapt the types used within `syn_parser` to align with the CozoDB schema, ensuring compatibility for data storage. This includes mapping `syn` types to CozoDB types (e.g., strings, numbers, UUIDs) and ensuring `Send + Sync` compliance for public types.
**Impact Areas**: `crates/syn_parser/src/parser/nodes.rs`, `crates/parser/types.rs`, `crates/syn_parser/src/parser/visitor.rs`, `crates/syn_parser/src/serialization/ron.rs` (potentially, if serialization needs to reflect the new types).
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium - Requires careful mapping of types and ensuring data integrity during conversion.

## Feature Flag Strategy
- Feature name: `impl_type_alignment`
- When to use: Apply feature flag ONLY when changes would break the codebase without completing all related subtasks.  We'_ll start without the feature flag, and add it if we need to.
- Usage example:
  ```rust
  #[cfg(feature = "impl_type_alignment"]
  pub fn new_function() { /* implementation */ }
  ```

## Subtasks

### Phase 
- [ ] 1.1. [Review existing implementation] - Understand the current type usage throughout the codebase.
- [ ] 1.2. [Identify affected components] - Pinpoint all places where type conversions will be needed.
- [ ] 1.3. [Analyze CozoDB types] - Thoroughly review the `cozodb_docs_types.txt` to understand the available CozoDB types and their characteristics.

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] 2.1. [Update `TypeId` definition] - Change `TypeId` to be an enum that can represent the CozoDB types.
  - [ ] 2.1.1. Define an enum `TypeId` with variants for `Null`, `Bool`, `Number`, `String`, `Bytes`, `Uuid`, `List`, `Vector`, `Json`, `Validity`.
  - [ ] 2.1.2. Update all instances of `TypeId` to use the new enum.
- [ ] 2.2. [Modify `TypeNode` to use the new `TypeId` - Update `TypeNode` to use the new `TypeId` enum.
  - [ ] 2.2.1. Update `TypeNode` to use the new `TypeId` enum.
  - [ ] 2.2.2. Update `TypeKind` to use the new `TypeId` enum.
- [ ] 2.3. [Convert `String` to `Bytes` where appropriate] - Identify fields that should be stored as `Bytes` (e.g., content hashes, potentially code snippets).
  - [ ] 2.3.1. Update `FunctionNode.body` to be `Option<Bytes`.
  - [ ] 2.3.2. Update `MacroRuleNode.pattern` and `MacroRuleNode.expansion` to be `String` to `Bytes`.
- [ ] 2.4. [Ensure `Send + Sync` compliance] - Add `Send + Sync` bounds to public structs.
  - [ ] 2.4.1. Add `#[derive(Send + Sync)` to all public structs.

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] 3.1. [Create tests for new functionality] - Add unit tests to verify the type conversions are correct.
- [ ] 3.2. [Verify existing functionality works] - Run existing tests to ensure the changes haven't broken existing functionality.
- [ ] 3.3. [Serialization tests] - Verify that serialization still works correctly with the new types.

## Dependencies
- Subtask 2.1 depends on completing 1.3.
- Subtask 2.2 depends on completing 2.1.
- Subtask 2.3 depends on completing 2.2.
- Subtask 2.4 can run concurrently with 2.3.
- Phase 3 depends on completing Phase 2.

## Implementation Notes
- The `TypeId` enum will be central to this task.  It will act as a bridge between the `syn` types and the CozoDB types.
- We'
- We should prioritize converting `String` to `Bytes` for fields that will be used as keys in CozoDB, as this will improve performance.
- Adding `Send + Sync` is a good practice for preparing the codebase for future concurrency improvements.
- We will start without the feature flag and add it if necessary.

Does this plan look good to you?  Would you like me to elaborate on any specific subtask or aspect of the plan?  Do you want me to start working on any specific part of this plan?
