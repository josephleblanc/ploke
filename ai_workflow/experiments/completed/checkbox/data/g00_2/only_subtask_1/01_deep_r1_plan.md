Here's the task breakdown with key considerations for type alignment:

| Subtask | Rationale | Effort | Breaking? | Feature Flag | Commit Message |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 1. Audit existing type representations in parser | Identify mismatch points between current type system and CozoDB schema | 2 | No | N/A | audit: map current type representations against cozodb schema |
| 2. Add CozoDB-specific type variants to TypeKind enum | Enable proper differentiation of Cozo types like Bytes/Vector | 3 | Yes | `feature_cozodb_types` | feat(type_system): add cozodb-specific type variants |
| 3. Implement type resolution/mapping logic | Convert Rust types to equivalent Cozo types (e.g. Vec<u8> → Bytes) | 4 | No* | Use same flag | feat(type_mapping): implement cozodb type resolution rules |
| 4. Update serialization modules | Ensure RON/other formats preserve Cozo type semantics | 2 | Yes | `feature_cozodb_serde` | fix(serde): update serialization for cozo types |
| 5. Add validation tests for type mapping | Verify correct mapping of Rust→Cozo types at parse time | 3 | No | N/A | test(type_system): add cozodb type validation suite |
| 6. Update documentation examples | Demonstrate proper Cozo type usage in public API | 1 | No | N/A | docs: update examples with cozo type usage |
| 7. Implement linter rules | Enforce Cozo type conventions in parsed output | 3 | Maybe | `feature_cozodb_lint` | feat(linter): add cozo type validation rules |

Legend:
- *Potential breaking in type-dependent systems
- High-risk components marked with feature flags
- Effort in ideal engineering hours

Key observations:
1. The TypeKind enum changes (#2) could break existing integrations relying on enum variant matching
2. Serialization format changes (#4) require coordination with downstream consumers
3. Linter rules (#7) could reveal hidden bugs as non-breaking

Recommend phased rollout with feature flags. Ready to discuss specific implementation details for any subtask.
